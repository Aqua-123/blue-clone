Saturn:- 'so now in effect all eme pics are dead'
A dude:- 'oooh'
A dude:- I'm wrong
A dude:- that error code is not caused by Callan disabling images, it's caused by Amazon cutting off his access to S3.
A dude:- 'well then'
Aqua:- 'what is s3'
A dude:- amazon's static file service
A dude:- 'how images are stored and fetched'
Aqua:- 'ooo'
Aqua:- 'and why did amazon cut it? '
A dude:- 'one common reason is when you stop paying your bill.'
Aqua:- 'lmao'
Aqua:- 'expected'
A dude:- but.. it's not the only one.
Aqua:- 'what are the other ones that can be expected here?'
A dude:- 'well. it might be my fault, in a way.'
Aqua:- 'o.o'
Aqua:- 'how-'
A dude:- I've been reporting child abuse images fairly diligently to the NCMEC, cloudflare, amazon and emeraldchat.
S​o​u​L:- 'wow'
Aqua:- 'oh wow'
S​o​u​L:- 'why emeraldchat?'
A dude:- 'in a sane world, each provider in the chain would have: reported it themselves to the NCMEC to avoid huge fines, kept all evidence for 90 days, and stopped distributing the content.'
A dude:- cloudflare doesn't itself host the content, so they're arguing that they can't remove that content. they do report it to the NCMEC tho.
A dude:- amazon however hosts the content, and since emeraldchat wasn't removing it themselves, they may have taken remediation steps themselves.
Blue:- Hi, Constraining Ewok, Welcome to WFAF, which stands for Waiting For A Friend, Let's keep it family-friendly, Enjoy your stay :D 
Aqua:- 'isnt cloudfare just ddos protection and stuff?'
A dude:- right. it's sits in between end users and other servers.
Aqua:- 'mhm'
Aqua:- 'that would explain wby robohash ones are working'
Aqua:- '*why'
A dude:- if that's what's happening, then Callan would need to actually deal with those reports correctly, and then see if he can get his S3 access reinstated, or find a new place to host his pics.
Aqua:- 'yikes'
S​o​u​L:- 'didnt he sold eme?'
A dude:- 'depends if you believe him or not.'
Aqua:- 'and people used to think heroku should take action'
Saturn:- 'he likely tried to sell'
S​o​u​L:- 'i dunno'
A dude:- he's made it clear that lying is okay for him because he's an entrepreneur, and that's what he thinks they do.
S​o​u​L:- 'ayo satt'
Saturn:- 'likely no one wanted to buy given the state eme is in'
Aqua:- 'soo... will RxE fix pfps? xD'
A dude:- nope. can't make something appear out of nothing.
Aqua:- 'thats fair'
A dude:- 'all the images are inaccessible until something change.'
Aqua:- 'mhmmm'
S​o​u​L:- 'lel, if u make a file hosting server and redirect the requests then yea ig?'
Aqua:- 'too much effort'
Aqua:- 'make a new site while you are at it then'
A dude:- 'I mean.. if we forget about all existing PFPs, then yes we could just upload pics to imgur and render those.'
