Saturn:- 'you can click each to get the profile up'
Saturn:- 'yes that is pretty bad'
🤖 Mecha Nurse 💉:-  maybe it's optimized for mobile phones. idk.\n
Saturn:- 'there has always been this concept that when a contact goes offline they disappear off the list'
Saturn:- 'its a very bad idea'
Saturn:- 'maybe he is relying on the insulting GC to gather users'
Saturn:- 'he used to have nearly all the time 30 users on the site'
Saturn:- 'with a rapid turnover of many other users joining and leaving'
🤖 Mecha Nurse 💉:- 'not bad. on par with emerald.\n'
