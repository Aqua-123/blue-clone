Blue:- Hi, K a e d a e (Ani), retrying won't help, you can try asking 'what is wfaf' for more info :D
Blue:- Hi, Mark , Welcome to WFAF, which stands for Waiting For A Friend, Let's keep it family-friendly, Enjoy your stay :D 
Blue:- Hi, Jamie Yowzah MkIIb, Welcome to WFAF, which stands for Waiting For A Friend, Let's keep it family-friendly, Enjoy your stay :D 
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'usually do'
A dude:- Hi Jamie. it's been a while.
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'seems one can never stay away'
A dude:- 'as you can see, things have slightly changed yet again'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- mhm, my DMs don't work, is that a known thing?
A dude:- 'do you crash as soon as you open them?'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'yes, everything but the nav bar vanishes'
A dude:- 'yeah.. one of your friends deleted their accounts.'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'oh good'
A dude:- 'and the app deals with it poorly.'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- read: doesn't deal with it at all
A dude:- 'righ'
A dude:- '*t'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'to be expected I guess'
A dude:- 'RxE has a workaround for it, fwiw.'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'meh, only appeared for the hell of it'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- plus I don't run RxE
A dude:- 'the PfPs are broken for everyone btw.'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'except robohashes'
A dude:- 'right'
A dude:- 'emeraldchat lost its s3 bucket.'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'probably because it was full of illegal stuff'
A dude:- 'it could be why, yes'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'does changing your profile pic fix it?'
A dude:- 'no, the upload tries to touch the bucket, so it fails.'
Blue:- Hi, Guarding Dolphin, Welcome to WFAF, which stands for Waiting For A Friend, Let's keep it family-friendly, Enjoy your stay :D 
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'ah fair, I wondered if they just deleted the bucket and made a new one'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'clearly not'
A dude:- that'd require Callan to notice, and then care.
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- correct me if I'm wrong, has he not sold out?
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'or did that fall through?'
A dude:- 'he claims he both has and will.'
A dude:- 'so who knows.'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- ok, so hasn't then
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'good to know'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'meh, like I said, only appeared for the hell of it. anything important people can message me on discord'
A dude:- ok.. I'll let folks know you came by
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- incidently, who's Blue's guardian?
A dude:- 'Aqua'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'probably should have worked that out to be fair'
A dude:- 'we have reached 12 guardians total, including Trix.'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'uhm'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- '12??'
A dude:- 'wait no, yours was Ellie'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'best I know, there was 5'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- '4?'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'eh, 4 and a half'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'Ellie, Tessa, Thea, Gumi/Pika, and Twi'
A dude:- 'Abra, Amy, Blue, Eva, Mecha Nurse, Megumin, Pikachu, Tessa, Twilight Sparkle, Thea, and then Ellie and Trix if they come back.'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'Megumin? who gave sen a greeter?!'
Blue:- Hi, Ally, Welcome to WFAF, which stands for Waiting For A Friend, Let's keep it family-friendly, Enjoy your stay :D 
Ally:- 'heyo '
A dude:- Abra and Pika are dio's, Amy is breshes', Eva is Soul, Megumin is.. a temp user's, and Nurse is mine.
Ally:- '??????? is this a coded message'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'right... and yours is based on Twi?'
A dude:- 'no, yet another ground rewrite.'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'yikes'
A dude:- 'all the new ones are.'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'fair'
Ally:- 'i’m invisible ;-;'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'wonder what the ground-up record is now'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- no you're not ally
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'we see you'
Ally:- 'heya '
A dude:- 'Megumin and Blue are python, mine is JS. not sure about Eva.'
K a e d a e (Ani):- '.'
A dude:- 'freaking python users.'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- mostly JS I'd assume
A dude:- 'probably'
Ally:- 'what are u guys talking about'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'python... uhg'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'no thanks'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- works fine until you're doing something complex and you have like a hundred indents
A dude:- 'well, they want to have smart bot replies and stuff, and a lot of ML stuff is in python.'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'pff, smart replies can be done in JS'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'in fact they were'
A dude:- 'agreed. worst case, made a node gyp thingy to tie into python.'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- that's cheating
A dude:- 'sure. but laziness is a virtue.'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'I considered using a WS client written in C# in one point, C# being my favorite language'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'really cba screwing around with it though'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'Ellie was 0 to basically working in 2 hours flat, good enough for me'
A dude:- 'WFAF is like one of those high-availability environments. we need redundant clean-room greeter implementations in many languages.'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'lol, right'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'for a badly-written broken-ass site, we need redundant greeters for a bugged chat room'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'totally makes sense'
A dude:- 'exactly'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'welp'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- I very much doubt you'll be seeing Ellie any time soon
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- with that lot around we're not needed 
A dude:- we've had a few greeter-less moments recently. my incentive to put nurse together.
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'hmm'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- this was something I couldn't get across to berry and co
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- we don't need to provide a service 24/7
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- not like we're paid for it
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'or recognised'
A dude:- right, we don't need to do any of it, of course.
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'take a tip from someone who knows'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- don't push yourself to do it
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- '100% not worth it'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'leads to bad things'
A dude:- right.. I think it's really just about the journey in this case.
A dude:- there's no happy ending.
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'nope'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'seen it go south'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'twice'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'both times into full on dumpster fire endings'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'not worth it'
A dude:- was dio's thing one of those?
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'mhm'
A dude:- 'he came back a couple of weeks ago'
A dude:- 'he sounds better.'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'I know, we talk'
A dude:- 'ah ok'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'he has more hours running a greeter in here than the rest of you combined'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'second only to Teri'
A dude:- I'm sure.
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'nearly 100% uptime on his own, since about christmas'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'and I guess you know how that ended'
A dude:- 'yeah'
A dude:- 'his was running in browser too. kinda impressive.'
Blue:- Hi, Purple monkey dishwasher , Welcome to WFAF, which stands for Waiting For A Friend, Let's keep it family-friendly, Enjoy your stay :D 
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- that's my code, thank you
A dude:- 'I had nurse running in browser last night, it died half way through the night.'
Blue:- Hi, Purple monkey dishwasher , retrying won't help, you can try asking 'what is wfaf' for more info :D
Blue:- Hi, Pink Cube, Welcome to WFAF, which stands for Waiting For A Friend, Let's keep it family-friendly, Enjoy your stay :D 
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'gumi was a copy of Thea, who was derrived from Ellie'
A dude:- 'the Mother of all'
A dude:- 'was Ellie literally the first greeter?'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'no'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'Thea and Tessa were'
A dude:- 'oh I see'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'bresh wrote those'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'then I made Ellie'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'then Thea was replaced with a copy of my code which Teri then customized the hell out of'
Blue:- Hi, Pink Cube, retrying won't help, you can try asking 'what is wfaf' for more info :D
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'to the tune of adding ~1000 extra lines of stuff'
A dude:- oh ok, so only Tessa and Amy are running Bresh's code now.
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'I would assume Amy == Tessa, yes'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'but yes, as far as I know mine holds the uptime record'
A dude:- 'assuming Eme sticks around long enough, the command line-based greeters might be able to beat that eventually'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'I would hope so'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- Ellie's code is a total mess
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'but she works'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- '*worked, not tested for the last month plus'
A dude:- 'indeed she does'
Blue:- Hi, Guarding Dolphin, Welcome to WFAF, which stands for Waiting For A Friend, Let's keep it family-friendly, Enjoy your stay :D 
A dude:- 'well, I remember Thea running at least.'
Blue:- Hi, Ally, Welcome to WFAF, which stands for Waiting For A Friend, Let's keep it family-friendly, Enjoy your stay :D 
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'Thea is Ellie, with some Teri magic for flavor'
A dude:- 'right'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'same as gumi/abra/pika'
Blue:- Hi, Pink Cockeral, Welcome to WFAF, which stands for Waiting For A Friend, Let's keep it family-friendly, Enjoy your stay :D 
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- to be fair, until / if they fix the profile pictures, I won't be bringing Ellie back
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- she needs the profile pic, doesn't feel right otherwise
A dude:- yeah.. hard to predict what's going to happen there
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- meh, to be honest I suspect we're witnessing the death throes of this service
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- given the child protection state it's in
A dude:- it definitely looks like it.. on the other hand, Callan's getting a good chunk of subscription revenue from it still, for very little work.
Blue:- Hi, Willy, Welcome to WFAF, which stands for Waiting For A Friend, Let's keep it family-friendly, Enjoy your stay :D 
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- he won't close it down
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- but it'll die
A dude:- I wouldn't be surprised if he ends up doing some minimal effort to keep it going.
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'from lack of users'
A dude:- right. that's the other new thing.
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'no picture sharing site-wide'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'no profile pics'
A dude:- someone's been crashing all the GCs at the same time for hours a day.
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'saw that in the discord, yes'
A dude:- 'does nothing to help user retention.'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'well'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'if I were a betting man'
Blue:- Hi, Ally, retrying won't help, you can try asking 'what is wfaf' for more info :D
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- I'd guess he's lost or killed the S3 bucket
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- so he doesn't have to deal with it's contents
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- 'which we all know is full of porn and worse'
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- he's reduced the instance the site runs on so it's cheaper
A dude:- 'right. users would probably have to upload new pfp if the feature ever comes back.'
Blue:- Hi again, Ally, try asking 'what is wfaf' for more info :D 
Jamie Yowzah MkIIb:- and he'll keep running it as long as income > expenses
