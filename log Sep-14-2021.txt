Aqua:- 'oh yes definitely '
A dude:- odd question maybe, but you'd be surprised how many Indian folks work in silicon valley companies.
Aqua:- 'mhm yea'
A dude:- 'at those large companies, I think the ratio for devs was 1/3 indian, 1/3 other asian, 1/3 white folks.'

Blue:- Hi, Popsmoke, Welcome to WFAF, which stands for Waiting For A Friend, Let's keep it family-friendly, Enjoy your stay :D 
A dude:- generally in smaller companies, you'll have more of a direct impact. also potentially crazier hours and more pressure.
A dude:- larger companies have a lot of projects going on, and maybe just don't pan out. half of the stuff I worked on died before launching. not great.
A dude:- 'brb'
Aqua:- 'okaii'

A dude:- 'back'
Blue:- Hi, Venus Gamorreans, retrying won't help, you can try asking 'what is wfaf' for more info :D
Aqua:- 'wb'
A dude:- 'anyway yes.. the core of the job as a developer is to build software stuff. product managers will come up with requirements for the product, designers will come up with what it should look like.'
Blue:- Hi again, Venus Gamorreans, try asking 'what is wfaf' for more info :D 
A dude:- 'then we come in and actually make it happen somehow. then QA looks at what we did and tries to find bugs. then stuff gets eventually deployed, or shipped or whatever.'
A dude:- in practice, it's never quite as streamlined
Aqua:- 'what is QA '
A dude:- product folks and designers need input from engineers to know what's feasible, and what's at the sweet spot of effort vs functionality.
A dude:- 'quality assurance'
Aqua:- 'ahhh '
A dude:- they're tech folks, and they often can code too
A dude:- but their focus isn't on building out product, but on making sure the product being built doesn't have bugs.
Aqua:- 'gotcha'
A dude:- 'some QA folks just click on stuff all day. others will write automated tests so their code clicks on stuff all day instead.'
A dude:- 'the latter get paid more'
Aqua:- 'lmao the more you click stuff the more you get paid'
A dude:- 'more senior engineers get to make more decisions about the technical direction of the product.'
A dude:- 'different companies have different ranks for those, but generally it\'s junior engineer, intermediate engineer, senior engineer, staff engineer, principal engineer, fellow engineer, and whatever else.'
Aqua:- 'in what aspects is an engineer different from a dev in terms of qualifications '
A dude:- 'oh. idk, I use the terms interchangeably to be honest.'
Aqua:- 'ahh fair'
A dude:- 'back in France, an engineer is a very specific term. you have to come from an engineering school to be able to call yourself one.'
A dude:- 'in the US, nobody cares.'
Aqua:- 'gotch'
Aqua:- 'a'
A dude:- 'the dirty secret of software engineering tho..'
Aqua:- 'so thats just senior dev taking decisions and other devs tryna get that to work'
A dude:- 'more or less'
A dude:- software engineers don't have a lot in common with other engineers.
A dude:- in proper engineering disciplines, you're expected to have some amount of rigor in your approach. you don't just try to build a bridge and see what happens.
Aqua:- 'haha yea thats fair'
A dude:- because if stuff fails, people die, and that's sad.
Blue:- Hi, Purple monkey dishwasher , Welcome to WFAF, which stands for Waiting For A Friend, Let's keep it family-friendly, Enjoy your stay :D 
A dude:- 'but most software work is basically non-sense.'
Aqua:- 'right'
A dude:- 'some have called it more an art than a science.'
Aqua:- 'ahh have heard that one or twice'
A dude:- 'now there is some technical knowledge behind it all.'
A dude:- but the rigor just isn't there. at least, not very often.
A dude:- for one, the schedules we work is don't allow for it.
A dude:- 'now there are exceptions.'
Blue:- Hi, Purple Beetle, Welcome to WFAF, which stands for Waiting For A Friend, Let's keep it family-friendly, Enjoy your stay :D 
Aqua:- 'hm-hmm'
A dude:- if you write code for  embedded software on a place, or a rocket, it's going to be a very very different experience.
Aqua:- 'yea that you can depend on hit and trial on things'
Aqua:- '*cant'
A dude:- 'but all the dot-com web nonsense everybody does is just that. non-sense. we use whatever the latest shiny frameworks are and we put together features that users want as fast as possible, and then there are a bunch of bugs and we just fix them as we go.'
Aqua:- 'sounds fun ngl'
A dude:- 'yeah, it kinda is I suppose.'
A dude:- 'and they can pay you quite well for this stuff.'
Aqua:- 'how busy is an average schedule of a dev?'
Aqua:- 'obv its variable on where you work'
Aqua:- 'but on an average'
A dude:- 'it depends. when I started, bright eyed and bushy tailed, I was probably putting in at least 60 hours a week.'
A dude:- 'it probably helped me get promoted and stuff, I suppose.'
Aqua:- 'ooooo'
Aqua:- 'i see'
A dude:- but now I'm at a point where I'm not really trying to impress anyone.
A dude:- I mostly just have this job so I don't get bored to death.
Blue:- Hi, Mrbanahna, Welcome to WFAF, which stands for Waiting For A Friend, Let's keep it family-friendly, Enjoy your stay :D 
A dude:- but I just put in my 40 hours, unless there's some really critical stuff happening.
A dude:- it'd still feel guilty if I let everything go to hell without helping.
Aqua:- 'ahh yes thats fair, 8 hours per day is that it averages out?'
A dude:- yeah. that's the basic expectation
Aqua:- 'gotcha'
Aqua:- 'i have like 6 months before i apply for uni and choose subjects'
Aqua:- 'excited and nervous '
Aqua:- 'still not decided what im gonna take'
A dude:- 'so.. not every developer here has a CS degree'
Aqua:- 'hmmm how does that work?'
A dude:- I've worked with people that only had a high school degree. also physics majors, a PhD in philosophy, some liberal art folks.
Aqua:- 'lol?'
A dude:- well.. you won't have that luxury if you want to move to the US unfortunately.
A dude:- 'H1-B visas and such require a relevant advanced degree'
A dude:- but in practice, I don't care about people's diploma all that much.
A dude:- if I interview someone and they can show me they're good at this stuff, I'll hire them
A dude:- 'well.. I was only a manager for a couple of years. so most of the time it was an I\'ll recommend that they be hired instead.'
Aqua:- 'oo i seee'
A dude:- that's highly dependent on the company culture tho.
Aqua:- 'yea was just going to ask if its the case everywhere'
A dude:- 'and even in those open minded companies, HR has a payscale where they\'ll pay the guy with a PhD much more than the guy with a high school diploma, for the exact same job.'
Aqua:- 'thats fair ig'
A dude:- I'm not sure if it is. but it's very common.
Aqua:- 'hm-hmm'
A dude:- 'generally, the more experience you have, the less the diploma matters during recruitment.'
Aqua:- 'but for initial experience that diploma is what matters right...'
A dude:- also, a lot of people lie on their resume, and it's usually super easy to figure out that someone doesn't know anything about a tech stack they claimed to have used for years.
A dude:- 'yeah. the diploma opens doors initially.'
A dude:- 'and in your case, borders too.'
Aqua:- 'mhm yeaa'
A dude:- 'what would you be studying if not CS?'
Aqua:- 'astrophysics or astrodynamics '
Aqua:- 'both being very different but both intrigue me '
A dude:- 'ah, that sounds fun too'
Aqua:- 'either way ill have to leave india'
Aqua:- 'not much opportunities for astrodynamics as well here '
Aqua:- 'and astrophysics'
A dude:- it'd probably be easier for you to study CS, and easier to get a visa with it afterward.
A dude:- but the astrophysics stuff could be more challenging and more interesting, if that's what you're into
Aqua:- 'hmm yea'
Blue:- Hi, Rattling Seel, Welcome to WFAF, which stands for Waiting For A Friend, Let's keep it family-friendly, Enjoy your stay :D 
Rattling Seel:- 'hi'
Aqua:- 'astrophysics is all research in the later part, which doesnt really seem interesting, well it can be for certain individuals, tho just siting and trying to think is something when my brain stops working'
Blue:- Hi, Rattling Seel, retrying won't help, you can try asking 'what is wfaf' for more info :D
Aqua:- 'hence why im considering cs'
Aqua:- 'because thats something i can rack my brain around all day really'
A dude:- 'would you have to get a PhD in astrophysics?'
A dude:- I haven't really heard of folks stopping with a bachelor in astrophysics.

Aqua:- 'hm-hmm'
Aqua:- 'btw why does js look scary at the first glance '
A dude:- 'does it'
A dude:- 'idk'
A dude:- it's probably become the most popular programming language on earth by now, so it can't be *that* scary
Aqua:- 'my brain just swicthes off just after seeing const and promise and it not executing in a sequential order like python '
A dude:- it's just as sequential as python.
S​o​u​L:- 'i may or may not agree with promise, but why const?'
A dude:- 'promises are async tho'
Aqua:- 'i dont var seems tame and const seems like a giant conster '
Aqua:- '*monster '
A dude:- 'const just defines a constant.'
Aqua:- 'i knoww'
A dude:- which is super misleading at first, since you can do `const a = {}; a.b=2;` and that doesn't feel very constant at all.
Aqua:- 'what was that'
A dude:- 'you define a constant variable that contains an object, but the object itself is still mutable.'
Blue:- Hi, Venus Horsea, Welcome to WFAF, which stands for Waiting For A Friend, Let's keep it family-friendly, Enjoy your stay :D 
Aqua:- 'ohhh'
A dude:- 'because in JS objects are handled as references, never as values.'
Aqua:- 'gotcha'
A dude:- 'so the variable `a` holds a reference to the object and that reference is constant.'
A dude:- but the object itself isn't
Aqua:- 'hmm-hmm'
Aqua:- 'sorta gotcha'
Aqua:- 'ill some day learn js'
A dude:- it's okay to learn it in pieces tbh.

Aqua:- everything i know rn in js (which is basically nothing) is by talking to straw and reading js code basically RxE and twi's code and sapphire
A dude:- 'which is fine'
Blue:- Hi, Crazymace, Welcome to WFAF, which stands for Waiting For A Friend, Let's keep it family-friendly, Enjoy your stay :D

Blue:- Hi, Neko (Shy but nice), Welcome to WFAF, which stands for Waiting For A Friend, Let's keep it family-friendly, Enjoy your stay :D 
A dude:- 'granted, there are much better ways to learn it now'
Aqua:- 'that gives some hope'
A dude:- 'but the basic language is still relatively simple. there are no explicit types, but everything still has a type under the hood. so 3 and 3 are different values, even though they can often (but not always) be used interchangeably.'
Blue:- Hi, K a e d a e (Ani), retrying won't help, you can try asking 'what is wfaf' for more info :D
A dude:- 'a lot of the concepts you learn in python will exist in some shape in JS.'
Aqua:- 'one is a string other is an integer?'
Aqua:- 'thats how it goes?'
A dude:- 'yes.'
A dude:- 'although the latter is a number'
Aqua:- 'right...?'
A dude:- 'which is an hybrid type that can be an actual integer, or a floating point value under the hood.'
Neko (Shy but nice):- 'Hewwo everyone'
A dude:- 'Hi Neko'
Aqua:- 'gotcha'
Neko (Shy but nice):- 'Hewwo a Dude\n'
Aqua:- 'Greetings neko'
Neko (Shy but nice):- 'Hewwo Aqua\n'
A dude:- it mostly doesn't matter, except when you use some operators that force a coercion from float to integer for example (like |, &, ^, ~)
eeee:- 'nothing is changing, A dude'
A dude:- 'load emerald chat first, then open the console, and set your cookies in there.'
A dude:- you'll need both the user_id and the prototype cookie
A dude:- 'then reload'
eeee:- I don't have though the prototype cookie, but it works in python with just the user_id cookie
A dude:- 'argh'
A dude:- 'grab your prototype cookies people.'
A dude:- 'right, there\'s a way without it.. a permanent cookie or something?'
A dude:- 'if you set that instead it might still work'
A dude:- aqua has used that, I haven't.
eeee:- 'ooh I mean in python you place it as header, the user_id and it works'
eeee:- but well in python you don't have the gui
A dude:- it might be enough for the websocket, but it's not enough for the web pages and web API
A dude:- 'you need one of those other cookies'
eeee:- 'I see, so umm what would happen if I just plug in the prototype cookie of some other account?'
A dude:- won't work
A dude:- if you don't have it, you may need to start using another account.

A dude:- 'the prototype cookie changes all the time too, but any of them will keep working.'
eeee:- remember_token, I've not seen that one, maybe it's only for permanent users

S​o​u​L:- 'u put both the remember token and prototype?'
Aqua:- 'either one of them'
Aqua:- 'they are interchangeable '
Earth Magikarp:- in a way, it didn't let me delete the previous cookie so it has both simulltaneously
Earth Magikarp:- 'I mean both of user_id not remember token '
S​o​u​L:- 'two userid at the same time? how?'
Aqua:- 'ohh sooo ill tell you whats happening, you are able to send texts because it has your user_id right but it needs the other cookie to recieve messages and the give notifications and such'
Aqua:- 'which it doesnt have'
Aqua:- 'open your network in dev tools'
Aqua:- 'you might see interesting stuff'
Aqua:- '^ this is a guess'
Aqua:- 'all of it really'
Earth Magikarp:- Okay I'll check what I receive
S​o​u​L:- 'ive never tried using just the user id'
Aqua:- 'websocket stuff works using just user_id'
Earth Magikarp:- 'and SouL I did that by using document . cookie = user_id = ...; expired = ... ; secure;  and a few other parameters'
Aqua:- 'ahh you just made a new cookie then'
S​o​u​L:- 'but how did u manage to put 2 userid at the same time?'

S​o​u​L:- 'u made those with two separate tabs?'
Earth Magikarp:- no idea if such was the case, I have many tabs open but it was mostly without willing, I was just trying to get the other account but couldn't actually do that
Aqua:- 'yk just make a new account? .-.'
Earth Magikarp:- 'lol I will :p'
Aqua:- 'lol good'
S​o​u​L:- 'does the both of them have the same exact properties? except the contents?'
