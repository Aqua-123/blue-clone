Twilight Sparkle 📚🔍🌟:- 'Testing, testing, Wan, two, three! ~*'
🔪·•°🖤°•·🗡:- 'Killin other people that went thru the same but on the other side\n'
A dude:- so that you'll kill someone when you're told to, I think.
A dude:- it's not as natural an act as one'd think, so it takes a good amount of conditioning.
🔪·•°🖤°•·🗡:- 'Of course its not natural\n'
A dude:- well, if you grew up watching TV, you'd be forgiven for thinking it's commonplace.
Twilight Sparkle 📚🔍🌟:- Hello, ‘Donlines’! Welcome to Waiting for a Friend. You probably tried messaging someone who wasn't your friend! Please be nice! *~~.

🔪·•°🖤°•·🗡:- 'I mean ig the army is not political?'
A dude:- it's not. it's shooty shooty-cal.
🔪·•°🖤°•·🗡:- 'Even so idk\n'
A dude:- schools are sanctuaries of knowledge. they shouldn't be intruded upon by folks that don't have your best intentions at heart.
🔪·•°🖤°•·🗡:- 'Right\n'
Alure:- It really wasn't about money for me
A dude:- some folks want to go in the military, and those are fine, they don't need someone to sell them the dream in their classroom.
Alure:- 'I just wanted to kill people that caused me emotional harm '
🔪·•°🖤°•·🗡:- 'As I said schools are supposed to ve apolitical idk theres something political on wanting to kill people on the army\n'
Alure:- 'Well marina '
Alure:- Most jobs in the military aren't combat focused 
Alure:- 'You could be a chef'
A dude:- 'but the folks recruited out of high school are the most likely to end up in combat.'
🔪·•°🖤°•·🗡:- 'True but idk. That institution job is to kill\n'
🔪·•°🖤°•·🗡:- 'Its like sharpening the hatchet someones gonna use for murder\n'
🔪·•°🖤°•·🗡:- 'You cant be called a saint\n'
A dude:- 'technically, the military is just a tool. governments can use it in different ways.'
🔪·•°🖤°•·🗡:- 'But hea ig just being a chef would be way more glamurous and would make you sleep very very well at night on comparison\n'
A dude:- 'they can be deployed in rescue operations after a disaster for example'

Alure:- It's crazy how much abuse our body's can take 
Twilight Sparkle 📚🔍🌟:- 'Testing, testing, Wan, two, three! ~*'
A dude:- 'yeah.. eating to fill up emotional holes is both easy and somewhat addictive.'
🔪·•°🖤°•·🗡:- 'I feel a lot how depriving myself of eating can give me pleasure its kind of the kinda pleasure you get from working out and your muscles hurt or you are tired and you think yea this must mean its working\n'
Alure:- The meals we ate were high in carbs because they knew we'd go long periods without eating 
Alure:- 'Ha '
