Earth Magikarp:- 'I used neptune ewok to find out how to get megumin into wfaf without my help '
S​o​u​L:- 'what?'
Earth Magikarp:- 'I mean suppose you open emeraldchat and you solve the captcha'
S​o​u​L:- 'mhm'
Earth Magikarp:- 'then you use this script and you enter into wfaf automatically'
Earth Magikarp:- 'no need to befriend anyone or to click on profiles or what have you'
Twilight Sparkle 📚🔍🌟:- Hello, ‘shane’! Welcome to Waiting for a Friend. You probably tried messaging someone who wasn't your friend! Please be nice! ~~.*~
Twilight Sparkle 📚🔍🌟:- Hello, ‘Damien’! Welcome to Waiting for a Friend. You probably tried messaging someone who wasn't your friend! Please be nice!

Twilight Sparkle 📚🔍🌟:- 'Hi again, ‘S\u200bo\u200bu\u200bL’! Try ‘twi wfaf’ for info. ~*'
Earth Magikarp:- 'but what do you mean SouL? what other way exists? '
S​o​u​L:- 'by calling the function to join a chat'
Earth Magikarp:- 'I call various functions to do that because of react, but there might be a simpler way'
Twilight Sparkle 📚🔍🌟:- Hello, ‘Datchillboi’! Welcome to Waiting for a Friend. You probably tried messaging someone who wasn't your friend! Please be nice! *~~.
S​o​u​L:- 'hmmm'
S​o​u​L:- 'i managed to send a friend req to myself so i can just click on messages on my profile to enter wfaf'
Earth Magikarp:- 'curious'
Earth Magikarp:- so that's the function you used to get here?
Earth Magikarp:- '(one that befriends - yourself)? '
Aqua:- 'okaii back'
Aqua:- 'what are we talking about'
Earth Magikarp:- 'hi bakc!'
Aqua:- ':>'
Blue:- '<:'
S​o​u​L:- 'u dont have to do that u cam directly call the function'
Earth Magikarp:- 'oh we were talking about getting here to wfaf without having to befriend people or click on profiles, which I just managed to do with megumin '
Aqua:- 'I once made a chatbot for omegle but I forgot which libraries I used, any ideas of best libraries to use in python?\n - use websockets library, thats the only way you can do it... can probably do it with selenium but thats useless'
Aqua:- 'ahh '
Earth Magikarp:- I was thinking selenium, I'll try websockets then 
Aqua:- 'selenium would be PAIN'
Aqua:- 'LITERAL PAIN'
Earth Magikarp:- 'why?'
Aqua:- '(yea ive tried)'
Twilight Sparkle 📚🔍🌟:- Hello, ‘notpumpkin’! Welcome to Waiting for a Friend. You probably tried messaging someone who wasn't your friend! Please be nice! ~~.*~
Twilight Sparkle 📚🔍🌟:- Hello, ‘notpumpkin’! Welcome to Waiting for a Friend. You probably tried messaging someone who wasn't your friend! Please be nice! 
Twilight Sparkle 📚🔍🌟:- 'Hi again, ‘notpumpkin’! Try ‘twi wfaf’ for info. ~*'
Aqua:- 'because..... resource intensive and... umm you are tryna simulate user stuff basically'
S​o​u​L:- 'isnt selenium a headless browser that does automation?'
Aqua:- 'websockets makes it much easier'
Aqua:- 'yea selenium is that'
Earth Magikarp:- I see, btw Aqua how do you get here to wfaf using python, my function is just a modification of the event when you click on someone's profile but I don't know if it would work with websockets
Earth Magikarp:- 'since it uses react, sounds like it would fit more with selenium but that would be resource intensive.. '
S​o​u​L:- 'u can somehow join channels with websockets'
Aqua:- 'how eme chats work is you first make a websocket connection with eme '
Aqua:- 'ok '
Aqua:- 'and then'
S​o​u​L:- 'u dont have to render the ui inorder to do that'
Aqua:- 'you can just send the requests of joining channels and sending messages using that websocket'
Aqua:- 'its all in the for of json'
Aqua:- '*form'
Aqua:- 'so youll send json, and receive json from eme'
Aqua:- 'thats how it would go'
Aqua:- 'and then youll have to decode jsons and all that'
Aqua:- 'fun stuff'
Aqua:- ':>'
Blue:- '<:'
Aqua:- 'nested dictionaries basically '
Earth Magikarp:- 'so maybe the App . . . join (null)  function? '
Aqua:- 'nope '
Aqua:- 'thats doesnt work'
Aqua:- 'ill tell you what it would look like'
Aqua:- 'after connecting to websocket '
Aqua:- 'youll send'
Aqua:- '{command:subscribe,identifier:{\\channel\\:\\RoomChannel\\,\\room_id\\:null}}'
Aqua:- 'that'
Aqua:- 'that would connect you to wfaf'
Earth Magikarp:- oooh thanks, I'll save that and see how it goes
Aqua:- 'sure '
Aqua:- 'and for sending messages '
Aqua:- '{command:message,identifier:{\\channel\\:\\RoomChannel\\,\\room_id\\:null},data:{\\message\\:\\Hi, I\'m Blue :D\\,\\id\\:null,\\action\\:\\speak\\}}'
Aqua:- 'something like that'
Aqua:- 'but replacing hi im blue wuth whatever you wana say'
Earth Magikarp:- 'I see I see! '
Earth Magikarp:- hi, I'm Megumin, explosion.. lol idk 
Aqua:- 'lmao'
Aqua:- 'also all this will be done using cookies'
Aqua:- 'like i basically never log in on blue account'
Aqua:- 'youll need user_id cookie'
Aqua:- 'for all this'
Aqua:- 'basically youll need it for websocket connection'
Aqua:- 'not after that'
Lawliet:- 'hi'
Twilight Sparkle 📚🔍🌟:- Hello, ‘Lawliet’! Welcome to Waiting for a Friend. You probably tried messaging someone who wasn't your friend! Please be nice! *~~.
Aqua:- 'so like just once'
Earth Magikarp:- 'Oh I imagined because of captcha'
Earth Magikarp:- 'and hi '
Aqua:- 'yea no there is no dealing with captchas here'
Earth Magikarp:- 'because of the cookies? '
Aqua:- 'also all this runs without the use of a browser, if you havent figured that out already'
Aqua:- 'yea'
Earth Magikarp:- oh I have figured that out, since it's not selenium
Aqua:- 'cookies are like straightup token that you are all signed in and good to go'
Earth Magikarp:- with my omegle bot I also used some library that didn't use a browser
Aqua:- 'your most likely used requests library'
Aqua:- 'ig '
Aqua:- 'thats one i can think off rn'
Earth Magikarp:- 'sounds familiar'
Earth Magikarp:- 'it might be'
Aqua:- 'right, btw if you think youll be able to port stuff from js to python, thats uhh yea not the case, youll have to more or less rewrite from scratch'
Earth Magikarp:- 'not entirely it still has some wisdom in it'
Aqua:- 'fair'
Aqua:- 'that might save you time, logic and all'
Aqua:- 'but yea'
Earth Magikarp:- 'yep'
