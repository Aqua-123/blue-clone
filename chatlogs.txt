Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-some specify a selection of colours from the palette
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-some are skip X pixels and draw 6 bit colour
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-and skipped pixels are set to the first palette colour
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-Bigger sizes are possible yes
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-Just want to keep it reasonable
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-Max for the format is 64 by 64
