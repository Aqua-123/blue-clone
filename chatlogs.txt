Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-I always give the small things to Aqua but then I do them thr next day
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-Haha
Harenoir(11427049) :-oh lol
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-We need more feedback as well
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-To tune the algorithm
Harenoir(11427049) :-hm, i see
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-Since its a preview, images may break and need to be reupladed
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-But the format shouldnt be tweaked after release
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-We can add new ones however while supporting old ones
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-Flexible code 😇
Harenoir(11427049) :-wow
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-that zero at the start
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-First thing I did is define 0 as the marker for the first format
Harenoir(11427049) :-so all pics are defined starting in 0
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-Mhm
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-Next digit specified width and height
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-Which is fixed to 48 by 48 for now
Harenoir(11427049) :-ah
Harenoir(11427049) :-so youre planning on working in bigger sizes
Harenoir(11427049) :-right?
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-Next is a palette of 9bit colours
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-8 of them
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-and then a stream of tokens
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-some specify a selection of colours from the palette
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-some are skip X pixels and draw 6 bit colour
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-and skipped pixels are set to the first palette colour
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-Bigger sizes are possible yes
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-Just want to keep it reasonable
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-Max for the format is 64 by 64
Harenoir(11427049) :-interesting
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-111111
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-minimum is 8 by 8
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-000000
Harenoir(11427049) :-hm... so itd be width, height and a color palette
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-when i first got it to display a flat colour i was proud
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-hm?

Harenoir(11427049) :-oof
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-I mean by all means enjoy
Harenoir(11427049) :-welp, this star i have for pfp is quite similar to the original

Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-Any notes by the way?
Harenoir(11427049) :-hmm...
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-Anything we should tweak or fix
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-J
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-I know of some things already
Harenoir(11427049) :-ive tested quite a few pics, but most of them are just random pixels
Lumi(16008266) :-Hello, Natsuki The Neko! Welcome to WFAF! - Waiting for a Friend! The place where your dreams used to come true~
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-Well
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-Send Aqua
Harenoir(11427049) :-but im guessing its because of compressed format
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-The original pics and tell him what haplened
Harenoir(11427049) :-oh sure
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-well yes
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-Its trying hard to fit it the palette
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-But it may be that its not well chosen
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-Most common colours worked at the 6 bit range
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-But at the 9 bit range
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-If similar colours are frequent, it pushes out the others
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-which are stuck being encoded as individual pixels, two chars each
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-I wonder how well the png format does actually
Harenoir(11427049) :-hmm
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-If that would work better lol
Harenoir(11427049) :-i usually work with png images the most
Harenoir(11427049) :-this star is a png
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-No I meat base64 png
Strawberry 🍓(16521287) :-mean
