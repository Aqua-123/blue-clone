Saturn (24897500) :- at the Equinoxes
Saturn (24897500) :- and will go into three so you can have eight hours sleep work relax maybe
Saturn (24897500) :- 24 will go into 4 which is maybe quite good for mealtimes
Saturn (24897500) :- dont babies eat four hourly?
Saturn (24897500) :- so thats dividing by six
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- no idea
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- but guess people thought a lot before setting it to 24
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Nelis! Welcome to WFAF! Welcome to the place where your dreams used to come true~
Saturn (24897500) :- you defniitely want to divide by 2 because after 12 hours you are pointing the opposite way

Saturn (24897500) :- who decided on these time divisions? THE DIVISION of the hour into 60 minutes and of the minute into 60 seconds comes from the Babylonians who used a sexagesimal (counting in 60s) system for mathematics and astronomy.  They derived their number system from the Sumerians who were using it as early as 3500 BC
