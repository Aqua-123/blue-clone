Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Mhm
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Red pills aren't fun
Saturn (19364487) :- oh
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Red pills meaning
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Realizing things that were hidden
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- And that affect how you live your life
Saturn (19364487) :- right
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- And your morals
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Plum Bee! Welcome to the place where your dreams used to come true!~
Lumi (16008266) :- Hi, Plum Bee! I'm afraid they aren't your friend yet, you can always try again!
Saturn (19364487) :- like bad experiences in the past maybe
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- I'd imagine taking a pill that would make me forget all these poor privacy practices in the services I used to use
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- That pill would be a blue pill
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- No, not really, Saturn
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Did you see the movie, Matrix?
Saturn (19364487) :- no I didnt
Saturn (19364487) :- i see these pills come from there
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- In it, the protagonist is given a choice between a red pill and a blue pill
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- The blue pill will see him living life as is
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- The red pill, that he chooses, means that he wakes up from his dream and realizes that reality is just a simulation he can learn to bend
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- But it involves becoming an enemy in the eyes of the simulation
Saturn (19364487) :- right
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- He learns that the food he eats is fake, and now back in the *actual* reality, he has to eat mush that doesn't taste like much
Saturn (19364487) :- quite a scary choice
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Mhm
Lumi (16008266) :- Your friendly neighbourhood Saturn is here! *~~.​
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- To know more and have a greater burden
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- That is to take the red pill
Saturn (19364487) :- mmm
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Some people have twisted it in political ways to mean realizing how we are controlled by Jewish people or whatnot
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Which is nonsense
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Liliana! Welcome to the place where your dreams used to come true!~
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Well hello again
Liliana (24235586) :- im back
Saturn (19364487) :- theres a whole conspiracy cult about that
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Are you here on purpose?
Saturn (19364487) :- hi again liliana
Liliana (24235586) :- hey
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Hm
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Lumi who's here
Lumi (16008266) :- List of users currently here: Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩, Lumi, Saturn, Liliana and 3 lurkers
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Anyways, the red pill I swallowed is about the difference between expectations and reality when it comes to privacy
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Well, at least one of them
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- I'm not letting it drive me mad, but there's a lot of work to be done
Saturn (19364487) :- yes
Saturn (19364487) :- privacy is a difficult issue these days
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Agreeable as always, Saturn
Saturn (19364487) :- it's been said that we might soon have really no privacy at all
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- I know you're careful online
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Boxing Chips! Welcome to the place where your dreams used to come true!~
Lumi (16008266) :- Hi, Boxing Chips! I'm afraid they aren't your friend yet, you can always try again!
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- You are probably more careful and less informed than me, at the same time
Saturn (19364487) :- yes probably
Saturn (19364487) :- careful in some ways at least
Boxing Chips (24232437) :- yup
Saturn (19364487) :- hi boxing chips
Boxing Chips (24232437) :- anyone bi? just asking
Boxing Chips (24232437) :- hi saturn
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- It reminds me of high threat models
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Avoiding correlation using personal info
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- I don't do that, I just try to make sure the info isn't retrievable long term in the first place
Saturn (19364487) :- seems a simpler, more effective plan
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Mhm
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- You don't have to push back your entire personality just to be safe online
Saturn (19364487) :- mmm
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Even Edward Snowden said that what should change is not people sending sensitive pictures to eachother
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- He said that what should change is the guarantees that people have WHILE doing so
Saturn (19364487) :- yes
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- That for example the NSA won't be gathering around a computer all looking at a sensitive photo that was intercepted from someone being monitored
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- As they used to do in one way or another
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- I can't blame you for being naturally careful
Saturn (19364487) :- mmm
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- But as someone who's grown confident and then pedaled back to be more private, I can say it's more of a learning experience
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- One that you can especially afford in places you don't plan to stay long term, or where you can change your nickname or change communities
Saturn (19364487) :- yes
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- The quaint carefulness where for example one of my teachers would never access the internet from her mobile phone
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- It sounds quirky just like what I do
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Yet the difference is, hers is a superstition, while mine is an informed decision
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Of course, we can't expect anyone to be a privacy expert
Saturn (19364487) :- yes
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- However, we need more people spreading truths, not superstitions and false escapes
Saturn (19364487) :- yes that would be helfpul
Saturn (19364487) :- there are some strange rumours that go around
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Mhm
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- I did a presentation in school recently on Privacy, Anonymitiy and Security.​ Hopefully it influenced some people in a positive way
Saturn (19364487) :- that does sound useful
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- And sharing the resources that I know.​ I wasn't going to let the opportunity slide
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Gainsaying Cylinder! Welcome to the place where your dreams used to come true!~
Gainsaying Cylinder (24197184) :- hey, i think the chat froze
Saturn (19364487) :- ah

Saturn (19364487) :- drinking coffee, playing games
Saturn (19364487) :- do some chores hopefully

Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Twi was going to have it too
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- But then I stopped having time to work on her
Saturn (19364487) :- right
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Liliana! Welcome to the place where your dreams used to come true!~
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Also, it might have been a lot of spaces and used to spam people
Lumi (16008266) :- Hi, Liliana! I'm afraid they aren't your friend yet, you can always try again!
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Used a lot of space*
Saturn (19364487) :- yes
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- It was just not high priority
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- As you can see, even Blue doesn't do it that often
Saturn (19364487) :- blue's seemed to get used to swap messages between Aqua and Teri
Saturn (19364487) :- until both took a break from WFAF
Saturn (19364487) :- and for Gashing Sphere too maybe
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Mhm
Saturn (19364487) :- karma seems almost non-existent these days
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- There's been changes
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- It is what it is
Saturn (19364487) :- it seems clear that whereas previously temporary accounts could karma anyone for their first day, now they cannot do karma at all
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Hopefully we can get RxE out soon.​ I'm waiting on Aqua currently to fix his bit
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Yes, indeed
Saturn (19364487) :- also it seems permanent accounts that could do karma once a day can only do it once forever now
Saturn (19364487) :- its going to be fun when RxE comes out
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Once a day?
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- That was the case long ago
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- I guess*
Saturn (19364487) :- that was what i heard
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- I assumed it was something like that when I was mking my first scripts
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Then it turned out it was once forever
Saturn (19364487) :- oh ok so thats not new
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- I may have said it, I had no real proof
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Mhm
Blue (21550262) :- What changed is the rate at which karma is processed by the server, slowed down a lot
Saturn (19364487) :- ahhhhhh
Blue (21550262) :- Which technically managed to fix a karma exploit 
Saturn (19364487) :- that is interesting
Blue (21550262) :- Which is and teri used for.​\u200b.​\u200b.​\u200b stuff
Saturn (19364487) :- so you give someone a karma but now it takes ages to happen
Blue (21550262) :- And max like 100 without killing the server
Blue (21550262) :- That also takes a couple moments to process
Saturn (19364487) :- so that slows it down too
Blue (21550262) :- correct
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- If it's fixed, can I finally know? xD
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- I'm curious how you found it
Lumi (16008266) :- The river of life bubbles when Aqua comes near ~*
‏ (14267520) :- how it basically worked is 
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Lumi who's here
Lumi (16008266) :- List of users currently here: Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩, Blue, \u200f, Lumi, Saturn and 3 lurkers
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Lumi who's idle
Lumi (16008266) :- I see Twilight Sparkle 📚🔍🌟, 🤖 Mecha Nurse 💉, Hullabaloo  lurking in the shadows.​.​.​
‏ (14267520) :- we spammed lots of veryyyyy quick karma requests from one single account 
‏ (14267520) :- which would actually manage to give multiple upvotes from one account 
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Occupying Pizza! Welcome to the place where your dreams used to come true!~
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Oh for fricks sake <3
Occupying Pizza (24237729) :- Heyy\n

‏ (14267520) :- and 
Saturn (19364487) :- ingenious you people :)
‏ (14267520) :- then we looped over all the accounts we had 
Occupying Pizza (24237729) :- ????
‏ (14267520) :- reached insane karma amount like 
‏ (14267520) :- one of mine has 180k
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Transaction moment
Occupying Pizza (24237729) :- \n??????
Occupying Pizza (24237729) :- \n
‏ (14267520) :- it was a real moment when we found it
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- I can feel that
Saturn (19364487) :- i expect you fell off your chair :)
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Do you mind if I share with the right-hand I mentioned?
Saturn (19364487) :- hardly no-one would imagine that in a lifetime
‏ (14267520) :- uhhh
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- I'll ask her if she had anything to do with the karma system first
‏ (14267520) :- sure
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- She no longer does anything for Emerald anyway
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- I still can't believe I'm friends with her and I had no clue haha
‏ (14267520) :- lmao
‏ (14267520) :- and the thing is the requests had to be super close for this to work efficiently and reliably 
‏ (14267520) :- cause how lupus explained it is working is 
‏ (14267520) :- it lets say exploiting the time it takes to actually register one request in the database 
‏ (14267520) :- and if we are quick enough
‏ (14267520) :- we can squeeze in multiple  
‏ (14267520) :- within that time frame 
‏ (14267520) :- and they all get registered 
‏ (14267520) :- sorta like ghost entries 
‏ (14267520) :- if anything
‏ (14267520) :- and now cause its rate limited so hard 
‏ (14267520) :- we cant even try it without killing the server 
‏ (14267520) :- and even if we do 
‏ (14267520) :- we wont be able to get the requests through fast enough 
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Mhm
Saturn (19364487) :- no more of seeing +300 fly across the screen in big letters
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Haha
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Well, I guess I was thinking it was something really smart
‏ (14267520) :- yeah-
‏ (14267520) :- we did tinker with a lot of stuff before landing here
‏ (14267520) :- exploiting cookies 
‏ (14267520) :- exploiting timeouts
‏ (14267520) :- and what not
‏ (14267520) :- nothing worked 
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- :)
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (16521287) :- Gosh
