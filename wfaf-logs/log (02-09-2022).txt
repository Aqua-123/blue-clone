Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- you probably don't
diamond heart (25138230) :- I've talked to a few psychiatrists before and none of them mentioned it as a possibility
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- to be fair diamond, aspergers would have affected you from birth, your schooling would have been difficult, at best
diamond heart (25138230) :- yes

diamond heart (25138230) :- I have trouble making friends but just in a social anxiety kind of way
diamond heart (25138230) :- and she also comments on how my tone of voice is always flat
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- that second one isn't generally an indicator of asd
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- if you actually talked to me IRL, generally people I'm comfortable with I have spirited conversations with
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- the flat voice is likely because she's a therapist and therefore not trusted
diamond heart (25138230) :- yeah
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and the social anxiety thing, that could be related to the other stuff
diamond heart (25138230) :- she said she'd have to have a session with my mom to ask her questions about my childhood
diamond heart (25138230) :- then she could decide if I have it or not
diamond heart (25138230) :- even if my therapist told me I do have it I wouldn't believe her
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I'm calling bull on that one, I'm afraid
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- for a start, she's saying aspergers
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- which is part of the spectrum but isn't the only option
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- if you have autism at all, you're on the highest end of high-functioning
Pikachu (25308787) :- Welcome Attracting Caribou to WFAF - Waiting for a Friend.  Say 'pika tldr' for more information!
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- so really for you if you do have it, it's a label and nothing else
diamond heart (25138230) :- makes sense
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- from the little I've seen of you over the years I don't see aspergers
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- north end of high-functioning ASD, maybe, barely
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- but really if you're being that pedantic a lot of people fit that
diamond heart (25138230) :- right
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- sorry
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- been very psychoanalyzed over the last couple of months
diamond heart (25138230) :- nothing to be sorry about
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- pet peeve, people waving that diagnosis around like party favors
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- it's not fun to live with
diamond heart (25138230) :- I understand that
diamond heart (25138230) :- considering I have been diagnosed with OCD before and people love to say they have it
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- yeah, that's one of those in fashion diagnoses 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- like stamping ADHD on kids
diamond heart (25138230) :- right
diamond heart (25138230) :- then putting them on prescription drugs for their entire life
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- oh yeah
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- usually because parents can't cope with behavior, because bad parenting
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I'm sure there are genuine cases out there
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- but I'd bet on 80%+ are just stamping labels on people
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- sadly both are spectrum diagnoses though, they run the gamut from barely a problem to severe and debilitating

Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- well, in that case ignore me then
„Ö§  (24039236) :- it was partly influenced by the fact that 
„Ö§  (24039236) :- heroku removed its free tier 
„Ö§  (24039236) :- and partly. . .  personal reasons 
„Ö§  (24039236) :- *his personal reasons

„Ö§  (24039236) :- mhm
„Ö§  (24039236) :- we did plan on working out a hack to host lumi on repl and we did end up running it successfully 
„Ö§  (24039236) :- but yeah

Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- less chance for people to try to break her
„Ö§  (24039236) :- pros and cons yada yada
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- yeah, I know
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- had that discussion
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- also I know emerald tends to have a bad effect on people who are here all the time
„Ö§  (24039236) :- it truely does yes 
„Ö§  (24039236) :- ive had my fair share of that tbh 
„Ö§  (24039236) :- but oh well 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- ditto
„Ö§  (24039236) :- weirdly interesting that a broken chat site could have such effects 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- lets face it, we tend to get the worst of humanity here
„Ö§  (24039236) :- true that

Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- yep
„Ö§  (24039236) :- and how did you deal with it?
„Ö§  (24039236) :- 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- or come back to it six months later and spent an hour trying to work out what the heck I was thinking
„Ö§  (24039236) :- oh lmao right 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- ngl usually at that point I either get very demotivated and drop it
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- or delete half of it and start again
„Ö§  (24039236) :- too far in to delete and start again, thats even more demotivating 
„Ö§  (24039236) :- so yeah dropping it is 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- well
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- that's what branches are for :)
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- start a branch, rework it
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- if it doesn't work, nuke the branch
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- if it does, merge and feel good about yourself
„Ö§  (24039236) :- its exhausting reworking that eugh code 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- if it's not great though it might be non-optional
„Ö§  (24039236) :- i mean firstly its 1400 lines in a file 
„Ö§  (24039236) :- scrolling through that is painful 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- that's not really a problem
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- or a record
„Ö§  (24039236) :- i mean its not a problem ubt when you wanna rewire stuff it sure doesnt help

Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- same as blue's reports I guess

Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- fair.  probably a good idea
Pikachu (25308787) :- Welcome Ellie to WFAF - Waiting for a Friend.  Say 'pika tldr' for more information!

„Ö§  (24039236) :- 
„Ö§  (24039236) :- i was impressed 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- to be fair Ellie is pretty simple, though the further down you go the messier it gets
„Ö§  (24039236) :- fair 
„Ö§  (24039236) :- mecha was. . . .  
„Ö§  (24039236) :- typescript 
„Ö§  (24039236) :- and node 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- Ellie is pure JS, you have to paste her into your browser console
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- doesn't play nice with RxE
„Ö§  (24039236) :- ah very classic 
„Ö§  (24039236) :- yeah i imagine its iffy with the message send command 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- actually it's more iffy with the hook cable bit
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I assume because RxE does the same thing
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- leads to very weird behavior
„Ö§  (24039236) :- i seee hmm
„Ö§  (24039236) :- blue seen mecha
