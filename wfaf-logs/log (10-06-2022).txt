Ivory Herring (24674065) :- yes
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- just logged me out
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- yet again
Saturn (19364487) :- this does seem to be a thing nowadays
Saturn (19364487) :- not very clear yet what leads to this
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- can't even register now -. -
Saturn (19364487) :- what does wrong with that?
Saturn (19364487) :- goes
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- just gives me 'invalid address
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- also
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- there's apparently a verification mail now
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- and well
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- i didn't use an actual mail with the last two accounts
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- so that's why i'm asking
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- maybe you really need to validate an account
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- to prevent bots
Saturn (19364487) :- im told there always was a validation email
Saturn (19364487) :- though im not sure
Saturn (19364487) :- and certianly in the past it was never helpful to respond to it
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- well i did
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- just now
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- so istg if i get deleted again. . . 
Saturn (19364487) :- deletion may be 1) not validating, 2) something to do with chatting 3) something to do wiht doing karma
Saturn (19364487) :- or someething else we havent thought of yet
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- didn't validate the account before seems like you didn't yours either
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- i did get karma boost today
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- but previous account got it pretty much immediately 
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- and went on for another 4 days
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- i was in 1on1 just now
Saturn (19364487) :- eme seem keen for people not to have their karma zapped, so they might have an issue with people zapping other peoples karma
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- prev i was jumping in between group chats
Saturn (19364487) :- or it coud just be a new bug they have invented
Saturn (19364487) :- this is a temp account
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- zapping karma?
Saturn (19364487) :- given eme took away all the ability for temps to hit people with karma, maybe they also get upset if perm accounts do it too much
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- oh. . . 
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- well yeah i did do that. . . 
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- i always do 
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- i did that for the 10 days
Saturn (19364487) :- maybe its that then
Saturn (19364487) :- after you do so many karma hits you get deleted
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- so for using integral part of the site?
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- neat
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- wonder why this place is essentially dead
Saturn (19364487) :- the thinking might be that people email them complaining they got banned
Saturn (19364487) :- so they are trying to avoid that happening
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- then remove karma all together . -. 
Ivory Herring (24674065) :- the people getting banned are the people that should be banned
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, <3! Welcome to the place where your dreams used to come true!~
<3 (24674065) :- it's so stupid
Saturn (19364487) :- is true for sure
Saturn (19364487) :- sadly websites often completely fail to communicate
Saturn (19364487) :- it might be more subtle, banning perm or temp accounts or paying accounts or amount of banning related to amount of people met
Saturn (19364487) :- we only gonna find out by careful observation i expect
<3 (24674065) :- should've just stuck here like a normal person
<3 (24674065) :- not like 1on1 has anyone sane nowadays
<3 (24674065) :- did callan have any views on wfaf

Saturn (19364487) :- Callan may have left and since Callan was super keen on karma that may be why karma is getting mangled now
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Eva! Welcome to the place where your dreams used to come true!~
Saturn (19364487) :- we once thought Callan came to WFAF but it was a false alarm

S​o​u​L (20327398) :- karma doesn't work anymore?

Saturn (19364487) :- temp accounts cannot do karma at all
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- hmm
Saturn (19364487) :- technically maybe perm accounts can do karma once in a lifetime against each separate user
Saturn (19364487) :- but they may get deleted if they do much karma?
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- maybe to prevent karma farming
Saturn (19364487) :- could be

<3 (24674065) :- yea
<3 (24674065) :- but they are all skipping me
Saturn (19364487) :- rather than deleting them later on, i think
<3 (24674065) :- i can't do it through inspect
<3 (24674065) :- no messages
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- hmm
Saturn (19364487) :- i doubt there is a limit to the number of accounts given people have been setting them up at a colossal rate for years
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- not the number of accounts
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- maybe its bad code

<3 (24674065) :- and possibly teri idk
<3 (24674065) :- oh
<3 (24674065) :- well if you right click and go click on inspect

S​o​u​L (20327398) :- idk
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- anyways
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- click on their profile
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- then open console
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- and type this:
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- UserViewReact .  state .  user .  id
<3 (24674065) :- oh
<3 (24674065) :- that's neat
<3 (24674065) :- thank you, soul
<3 (24674065) :- :)
Eva (21541886) :- (:
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- if u write it like this:
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- copy(UserViewReact .  state .  user .  id)
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- it'll copy it to your clipboard
Saturn (19364487) :- so an account got bumped up to plus 35 karma, which prompted Eme to delete it
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- wow
<3 (24674065) :- it got bumped up to 40 and stayed for a bunch of days before . -. 
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- so now its even worse
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- like
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- make 35 accounts
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- and u can delete anyones account
<3 (24674065) :- if that's what caused it
Saturn (19364487) :- well there is that Soul
Saturn (19364487) :- what a disaster
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- yuuup
Saturn (19364487) :- i was told that each karma transaction is stored againt the account
Saturn (19364487) :- when the account is deleted it then takes forever and freezes eme
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- now ppl gonna farm others to ban em
Saturn (19364487) :- presumably because eme is deleting all these karmas individually
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- hmm
Saturn (19364487) :- so eme might have decided that once an account gets so much karma they will delete it
Saturn (19364487) :- to avoid issues later on
<3 (24674065) :- . -. 
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- that would be the case

Saturn (19364487) :- and it had umpteen 14 year old girls who were being chatted to by a very bad guy in a certain part of USA
Black Square (24674470) :- The P spot refers to the prostate, a small walnut-sized muscular gland that produces the seminal fluid that helps sperm travel and to survive.  When stimulated, the p spot creates an intensely pleasurable sensation during orgasm. \n\nCompared to penile orgasms, prostate orgasms often require a shorter refractory period or recovery time in general.  For that reason, prostate orgasms are sometimes associated with the possibility of multiple orgasms.  It may even be possible for some men to achieve orgasms through prostate stimulation alone. 
Saturn (19364487) :- they all livedd near him
<3 (24674065) :- oh yeah
Saturn (19364487) :- black square please dont

<3 (24674065) :- Just because virtual learning has your children spending more time on school computers doesn't mean they're sticking to math, English, and science.  The recent abduction of a North Carolina 14-year-old girl has authorities warning parents about a popular chat app the girl used to communicate with her alleged abductor.  Janet Roach shows us what Emerald Chat is, and some other apps that could be dangerous. \n
<3 (24674065) :- POPULAR char app
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- it is popular
<3 (24674065) :- if you say so
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- just look at the number of accounts here
Black Square (24674470) :- DICK
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, S\u200bo\u200bu\u200bL! Welcome to the place where your dreams used to come true!~
Eva (21541886) :- thu_thu
<3 (24674065) :- mhm
<3 (24674065) :- how many of them are for karma farms again?
<3 (24674065) :- people that use temps each time they come
<3 (24674065) :- etc. 
Black Square (24674470) :- There are two ways to locate the p spot - internally or externally.  You may do this solo or with a partner.  Since the prostate gland swells during arousal, it would be easier to find it when you are already turned on. \n\n
Lumi (16008266) :- Hi, S\u200bo\u200bu\u200bL! I'm afraid they aren't your friend yet, you can always try again!
Eva (21541886) :- thu_thu
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- eva kill me
Black Square (24674470) :- Finding the P spot and knowing how to stimulate it can be tricky - and it may take some time, practice, and a lot of patience to get to the fun part.  Whether you are doing it alone or with your partner, practicing safety is the best way to get started. \n\n
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- *my internet
<3 (24674065) :- seems like it's killing itself constantly
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- $ mute 24674470
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- eva?
Eva (21541886) :- aight, imma pretend like they dont even exist ;)
<3 (24674065) :- who's that
<3 (24674065) :- is it me
<3 (24674065) :- idk my new id yet
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- $ whois 24674470
Eva (21541886) :- Details of 24674470: \nDisplay name: Black Square, \nUsername: u791139178cdedd21, \nKarma: -1, \nGender: null, \nCreated at: 2022-06-10T12:11:40. \u200b092Z
<3 (24674065) :- oh
<3 (24674065) :- does she mute them for you too?
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- nope
<3 (24674065) :- doesn't seem like they are paying much attention to eva
Black Square (24674470) :- Anatomically, the prostate is located between the rectum and the bladder.  A direct way to feel the prostate is through the anus, about two inches deep or about the first knuckle in if you are using your finger. \n\n
Black Square (24674470) :- Make sure the anal area, as well as your fingers, are as clean as possible.  Using gloves and lubricant may also ease up the process.  You may feel minor discomfort for the first attempts, but it should not cause unbearable pain. \n\n
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- atleast it won't be checking for commands in each messages they send 
Black Square (24674470) :- Start by massaging the anal area and then slowly slip a finger or two.  Find the prostate by gently performing the "come here" gesture.  Men may feel the sensation of needing to pee - meaning you are in the right spot since the prostate is near the bladder. \n\n
<3 (24674065) :- oh
<3 (24674065) :- i guess
<3 (24674065) :- idk
<3 (24674065) :- i don't have a bot
Black Square (24674470) :- You can also stimulate the prostate via the perineum, the area between the scrotum and the anus.  This tender and sensitive spot consist of numerous erotically charged nerve endings, making it a less penetrative option to achieve orgasms. \n\n
Black Square (24674470) :- In external prostate massage, you may not feel the p spot directly.  However, just like the internal prostate massage, touching this area may cause the sensation of having to pee. \n\n
S​o​u​L (20327398) :- even tho it doesn't take much time to perform such checks
<3 (24674065) :- sure
<3 (24674065) :- maybe should mute me too
Lumi (16008266) :- Hi again, S\u200bo\u200bu\u200bL, don't feel bad, they'll accept one day. . .  hopefully!
Eva (21541886) :- thu_thu

Saturn (19364487) :- misusing the term air drop
<3 (24674065) :- -\\_(tsu)_/-
<3 (24674065) :- no idea
Saturn (19364487) :- poor Spooky unhappy was so excited before
Saturn (19364487) :- the thing about tags is some people who seem quite normal otherwise have some bad tags
Saturn (19364487) :- we may have an uphill task to get people to ditch those tags
<3 (24674065) :- idk
Saturn (19364487) :- one very well known eme member who i believe was one of the original mods has an unacceptable tag
<3 (24674065) :- i always wondered why when karma bombing and stuff was possible
<3 (24674065) :- the tags didn't get filled with bots
<3 (24674065) :- who'd just get the people banned and reported
Saturn (19364487) :- you mean bots to use the tags to catch people?
<3 (24674065) :- something like that yeah
<3 (24674065) :- plenty of bots in chats 
<3 (24674065) :- and there is the option to wait until someone with the same tag shows up
Saturn (19364487) :- im sure some people did put bad tags to catch other people
Saturn (19364487) :- but they probably messed about
Saturn (19364487) :- its probably best to leave those kind of tricks to the proper authorities
<3 (24674065) :- who are clearly doing all they can to battle this stuff
Saturn (19364487) :- i hear theres a lot of specialist police units pursuing offenders online
Saturn (19364487) :- and the main social media sites have adopted various improvements to deter and remove offenders
Saturn (19364487) :- theres various technical developments to help deal with online offenders
<3 (24674065) :- or you could just make pedophilia something that you can get capital punishment for
<3 (24674065) :- discord is a major communication platform 
<3 (24674065) :- you see how many grooming and pedophilic claims are over that
<3 (24674065) :- sites like eme that flat out have the option for interest tags filled with these degenerates 
<3 (24674065) :- they give them out on a silver platter
Saturn (19364487) :- clearly it would be better if eme would do much more
Saturn (19364487) :- so far they only make improvements by breaking things
Saturn (19364487) :- maybe they will break all the tags next
Saturn (19364487) :- reading the discord rules they seem quite hot on criminal behaviour
Saturn (19364487) :- and i hear people often have their sites shut down
Saturn (19364487) :- or their accounts
