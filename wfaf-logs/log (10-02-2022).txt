Lumi (16008266) :- Personal pizzas all around! Harenoir has arisen from the void!
Blue (21550262) :- Gashing Sphere:- Hi\n
Blue (21550262) :- Hello Harenoir I have a few messages for you from some people
Blue (21550262) :- ⠀:- Would you like to be my valentines?
Harenoir (11427049) :- ^ no
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- aww
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- Noir
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- your picture is
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- gorgeous
Harenoir (11427049) :- aww
Harenoir (11427049) :- thank you !
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- :)
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- have you noticed any problems?
Harenoir (11427049) :- not really
Harenoir (11427049) :- all working good
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- oki <3
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- that tells me we did a good enough job
Harenoir (11427049) :- appreciated <3
Lumi (16008266) :- Nyan nyan its lumi <3
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- if we really wanted we could optimize it with hilbert curves lol
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- nyan nyan <3
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- but something tells me we should focus on fixes lol
Harenoir (11427049) :- hm...
Harenoir (11427049) :- fractals
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- discrete approximations of fractals
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- hilbert curve preserves locality
Harenoir (11427049) :- i see
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- meaning closeby colours are likely to be close to eachother
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Celebrating Venusaur! Welcome to WFAF! - Waiting for a Friend! The place where your dreams used to come true~
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- so when you have an image of, say, a circle
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- so you get more clumps of the same colour when you stretch the curve into a line
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- instead of going row by row
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- well, bigger clumps, fewer of them
Lumi (16008266) :- Hi, Celebrating Venusaur! Im afraid they arent your friend yet, you can always try again!
Harenoir (11427049) :- interesting
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- because some images are good for horizontal scanlines, like backgrounds
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- but if you have like a column on a building
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- then its gonna get passed through on each horizontal pass
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- when i said backgrounds, i meant sky, since the horizon in horizontal
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Tonguelasher! Welcome to WFAF! - Waiting for a Friend! The place where your dreams used to come true~
Lumi (16008266) :- Hi, Tonguelasher! Im afraid they arent your friend yet, you can always try again!
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- anyways, enough tlaking
Harenoir (11427049) :- oof
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- my regexp is giving me a recursion error lol
Harenoir (11427049) :- damn
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- yeah we thought it was our code wrapping itself up but
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- nope, just a regex
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Ivorydaddy! Welcome to WFAF! - Waiting for a Friend! The place where your dreams used to come true~
Lumi (16008266) :- Hi again, Tonguelasher, dont feel bad, theyll accept one day... hopefully!
Harenoir (11427049) :- i hear about regex a lot
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- oh do you know what they are?
Harenoir (11427049) :- meanwhile i barely understand it ;-;
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- or not
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- aw
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- -pats-
Harenoir (11427049) :- ty !
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- okay, so, regexes are templates for what to find in a string of characters
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- you can enter just one character if you want to look for it
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- or you can say you want to match any number, thats done with a star after the character
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- any number of characters*
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- so like /a/ matches a but not aaa or b
Harenoir (11427049) :- huh
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- however /a*/ matches aaaa as well as a and  (empty string)
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- so imagine something like
Lumi (16008266) :- Our favorite Blue greeter is here!
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- that matches father and grandfather
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- ? = optional
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- does that make sense?
Harenoir (11427049) :- would it match only grand too?
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- nope
Harenoir (11427049) :- why tho
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- because none of the other characters are marked as optional
Harenoir (11427049) :- hm
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- it goes i want something but it\s optional, and that something is \grand\ 
Harenoir (11427049) :- alright
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- okay i found grand, now i need f
Harenoir (11427049) :- ahh
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- oh there\s no f
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- abort
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- check this out
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- /((great )* grand)?father/
Harenoir (11427049) :- uh-
Harenoir (11427049) :- lets see
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- so first we can match /(great )* grand/ but we dont have to
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- if we dont we skip ahead and straight up require an f
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- if we want to match /(great )* grand/ we can get any number of great  and then exactly one grand
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- so grand works
Harenoir (11427049) :- ah, so that way
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- great grand and great great great grand work
Harenoir (11427049) :- you can get a lot of great
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Jupiter Cube! Welcome to WFAF! - Waiting for a Friend! The place where your dreams used to come true~
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- but great alone doesnt
Harenoir (11427049) :- and just one grand
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- yep
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- so all in all
Harenoir (11427049) :- huh
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- you can get, father, grandfather, great grandfather, etc
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- if we did something like /(great )*(grand)?father/
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- then it wouldnt be what we want
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- do you see why?
Harenoir (11427049) :- because of the () in grand?
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- nope
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Eva! Welcome to WFAF! - Waiting for a Friend! The place where your dreams used to come true~
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- lets say we get
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- great father
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- so we get one great  which matches /(great )*/
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- and then we optionally get a grand, we didnt get it this time, thats ok
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- and then we get a father, which we got, so its correct
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- but obv great father and great great father arent on the family tree
Harenoir (11427049) :- right
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- if you have any number of great s, then it requires you to have at least one grand
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- okay
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- also, the pipe | means or
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- so we can expand all this to
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- /(great )* grand)?father|dad/
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- so it matches everything on the right or everything on the left
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- so now we have dad, father, grandfather...
Harenoir (11427049) :- in that way, we would get both great grandfather and great granddad 
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- nope
Harenoir (11427049) :- wait no?
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- because everything on the left gets grouped
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- its like (...) | (...)
Harenoir (11427049) :- oh
Harenoir (11427049) :- oh right
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- if it didnt then it would only take one letter
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- great grandfather vs great grandfathedad
Harenoir (11427049) :- so its like
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- because each letter is its own thing
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- thats why we have to have the parentheses
Harenoir (11427049) :- the whole of that great grand father stuff
Harenoir (11427049) :- and dad alone
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- mhm
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- /hello?/ matches hello and hell
Harenoir (11427049) :- why does that happen?
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- each letter is its own thing and the question mark only applies to the last thing
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- it doesnt consider words together
Harenoir (11427049) :- hmm
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- so like
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- /ht\u200btps?:\\/\\//
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- is the start of a URL
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- and because slash is an important character that means something
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- it has to be preceded with a backslash to say, hey i mean this character literally, don\t end the regular expression yet
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- so for example a dot on its own means any character
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- and a real dot is matched like \\.
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- a real question mark is \\? because the question mark already means something
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- so if you want to match any question, youll just look for sentences which end with question marks
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- so thats /.+\\?/
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- * = 0 or more
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- + = 1 or more
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- so here... 1 or more of anything, and then one question mark
Harenoir (11427049) :- +\\?/ this would be the way to look for actual question marks
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- which is mostly what a question is
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- no the + belongs to the dot
Harenoir (11427049) :- oh
Harenoir (11427049) :- then only the \\?/
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- and the / ends the regular expression
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- so only the ?
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- \\?
Harenoir (11427049) :- ah-
Harenoir (11427049) :- \\?
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- yep
Harenoir (11427049) :- there
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- also you can put certain letters after the slashes
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- for example /y/i
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- matches \y\ and \Y\ because the i flag means case *i*nsensitive
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- so /y/ matches y only but /y/i is the same as /y|Y/
Harenoir (11427049) :- so the i already means something too
Harenoir (11427049) :- at the end
Harenoir (11427049) :- what about /i/i ? that would be i and I?
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, ⠀! Welcome to WFAF! - Waiting for a Friend! The place where your dreams used to come true~

Lumi (16008266) :- I can see Eva, Lumi, Harenoir, ⠀ and 3 lurkers
⠀ (20199174) :- lumi whos idle
Lumi (16008266) :- I see Strawberry 🍓, Blue, 🤖 Mecha Nurse 💉 lurking in the shadows...
⠀ (20199174) :- teri u saw the messages :D
Harenoir (11427049) :- i did
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- back
Lumi (16008266) :- Hi, Convening Raven! Im afraid they arent your friend yet, you can always try again!
Convening Raven (23537947) :- yo
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- and yes /i/i matches i and I
Harenoir (11427049) :- okay
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- the i at the end is a flag
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- flags come after the final slash
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- the g flags means that the regex can look for multiple matches
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- it will only get one at a time so this is mostly a programming thing
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- m is multiline
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- s is sticky i think but i don\t remember what that does
Harenoir (11427049) :- hm...
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- and u is unicode which lets you use a special escape sequence to specify Unicode characters with more than two bytes
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- had to use that one recently
Harenoir (11427049) :- noted, and noted
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- okay
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- next thing to learn are what brackets  do
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- which is
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- they pick one character from the ones you put in
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- and you can also specify ranges of characters like a-z or 0-9
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- or invert the selection (any character BUT these) by starting it with a circumflex ^
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- sorry, caret
Harenoir (11427049) :- so like, an interval of certain characters
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- yep
Harenoir (11427049) :- huh
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- so, /a-b+0-9+^t/ matches
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- a string of as and bs that has at least one character +
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- a string of digits with at least of digit +
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- exactly one character thats not t
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- so, for example ababbb023024q
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- or even a space at the end would work
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- in my url parser im using something like
Harenoir (11427049) :- ababbabab5646646j
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- yep
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- -a-z0-9@:%_+\\.~#?&=
Harenoir (11427049) :- oh-
Harenoir (11427049) :- whats that-
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- one of the brackets has to be escaped so it doesnt look like it ends the bracket group thingy
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- well, its
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- match one character thats
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- a) a letter
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- b) a digit
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- c) the at sign, or the colon, or the percent sign, or the underscore
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- d) either of the brackets

Jacob (19735946) :- I speak robut
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- haha okay
Harenoir (11427049) :- so its a whole interval for all of those characters
Jacob (19735946) :- Im cheating on you with cantelope
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- yep noir
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- any of them will do
Harenoir (11427049) :- alright
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- its easier than (a|b|c|d|...)
Harenoir (11427049) :- oof
Harenoir (11427049) :- (i can see myself doing that)
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- you dont wanna be that kinda programmer
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- hsdijhsadjkhsda
Harenoir (11427049) :- lmaoo
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- function isEven(n) {
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- if (n == 0) return true
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- if (n == 2) return true
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- sdkjsdkjsd
Harenoir (11427049) :- lmaoooo
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- anyways
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- now that you know that
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- theres some other things that the backslash is used for
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- some common escape sequences
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- \\d means digit, \\w means word character
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- which is
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- alphanumeric + underscore
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- \\s means any whitespace
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, KING BLUE! Welcome to WFAF! - Waiting for a Friend! The place where your dreams used to come true~
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- and you can make these capitalized to mean anything but
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- so \\S is anything but whitespace
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- = anything but spaces, tabs, etc
Harenoir (11427049) :- \\D -> antyhing but digit
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- yep
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- Ill recommend regexr.\u200bcom/ to play around
Harenoir (11427049) :- ohh
