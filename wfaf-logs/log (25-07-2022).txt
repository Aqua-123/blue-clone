Madeleine (25113041) :- i can hear diamond thinking
diamond heart (24872539) :- thinking about computer components
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- o. o

Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- I wonder what noise is that
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- maybe like old dial or old printer
diamond heart (24872539) :- I just built a pc last month
diamond heart (24872539) :- but maybe I need more SSDs
diamond heart (24872539) :- and I dunno if an SSD with a heatsink will fit under my gpu
Pikachu (24960047) :- Welcome Jam to WFAF - Waiting for a Friend.  Say 'pika tldr' for more information!
Madeleine (25113041) :- you're calculating
diamond heart (24872539) :- equations flying left and right around my dome

Madeleine (25113041) :- someone who might know
diamond heart (24872539) :- cough jamie
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- hello?
Jam (25020557) :- Hey
Madeleine (25113041) :- i was thinking him too for some reasons
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- generally you don't need a heatsink for your SSD
Jam (25020557) :- Haha 
diamond heart (24872539) :- noted
diamond heart (24872539) :- blue serve samsung 980 pro
Blue (21550262) :- Image: i. \u200bimgur. \u200bcom/yuyE0G0. \u200bjpeg
diamond heart (24872539) :- 250gb get that out of here blue
diamond heart (24872539) :- throw it in the trash
Madeleine (25113041) :- so you're not getting a heatsink then\n
diamond heart (24872539) :- at the moment it costs the same with a heatsink
Madeleine (25113041) :- ah\n
diamond heart (24872539) :- so if I get that and it doesn't fit I can just take it off
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- depends
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- some companies literally glue the heatsinks on
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- you won't get that off in a hurry, you'll rip the ICs off first
Madeleine (25113041) :- wow 
diamond heart (24872539) :- should be able to google it
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- to be fair it's not 5-minute epoxy that they use, they use rated thermal adhesive
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- correction: they mostly use rated thermal adhesive
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- super-cheap ones, probably 5 minute epoxyt
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- *epoxy
diamond heart (24872539) :- I also have a third m. 2 slot not under my gpu
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- depending on your motherboard, some of those M. 2 slots might be shared with a PCIe slot
diamond heart (24872539) :- well the extra m. 2s are parallel with the 2 PCIe slots below my gpu PCIe slot, but the GPU still covers the higher m. 2 slot
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I'd go for trying to remove the heatsink if it's clipped or screwed on
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- if not, do you have a second x16 slot to move your GPU into?
diamond heart (24872539) :- nope
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- or, can you swap your M. 2 slots around so that your heatsinked SSD isn't under your GPU
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- hmm
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- heatsinked?
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- heatsunk?

Saturn (19364487) :- long chat logs get shut off earlier now
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- the exploit I mentioned a while ago, uncapped karma farming
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- that still works
Saturn (19364487) :- yes
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- just not with a temp

Saturn (19364487) :- so you understand now, Madeleine?
Madeleine (25113041) :- I guess
Saturn (19364487) :- Jamie is the expert on programming :)
Madeleine (25113041) :- should I worry
diamond heart (24872539) :- the only thing slowing down the karma farming was the captchas to make a new temp
diamond heart (24872539) :- then the temp goes in and downvotes everyone on a list in an instant
diamond heart (24872539) :- while also upvoting a separate list
Saturn (19364487) :- soooo many traffic lights
Saturn (19364487) :- sooo many yellow taxis
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- not anymore, temps can't give karma

Saturn (19364487) :- things in a complete fuzzy fog
Saturn (19364487) :- you only get those if google is super annoyed with you
Saturn (19364487) :- best to just skip those ones
Saturn (19364487) :- maybe go have a tea break and give google time to calm down
Saturn (19364487) :- anyway at last we can safely browse all over GC now, because we arent going to get karma zapped any more
Pikachu (24960047) :- Welcome M bi to WFAF - Waiting for a Friend.  Say 'pika tldr' for more information!
Saturn (19364487) :- even if we do it with zero karma
Saturn (19364487) :- times past, even to stick the end of your nose into GC and you were banned for a day or longer
Madeleine (25113041) :- ohh
Saturn (19364487) :- and they would come in WFAF and merrily ban everyone too
Madeleine (25113041) :- that explains why some of you have thousands upvotes

Madeleine (25113041) :- friends?
Saturn (19364487) :- not sure what you are asking, Madeleine
Madeleine (25113041) :- 10k friends\n
Saturn (19364487) :- dio, you are able to use search to check your accounts?
Madeleine (25113041) :- diamond had\n
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- no, 10k karma
Madeleine (25113041) :- well that's useless
Saturn (19364487) :- well at the time it could be useful
Saturn (19364487) :- was an arms race

a (13434296) :- its not an anti anxiety supplement lol but I clench my teeth lots cus of anxiety 
a (13434296) :- and it helped that alot so
Saturn (19364487) :- Magnesium citrate is a magnesium preparation in salt form with citric acid in a 1:1 ratio.  The name magnesium citrate is ambiguous and sometimes may refer to other salts such as trimagnesium citrate which has a magnesium:citrate ratio of 3:2
diamond heart (24872539) :- In magnesium deficiency, neuronal requirements for magnesium may not be met, causing neuronal damage which could manifest as depression. 
EL (25118628) :- If you have anxiety then just don't. 
diamond heart (24872539) :- basically malnutrition
a (13434296) :- then just don't what?
Saturn (19364487) :- Magnesium citrate is used medicinally as a saline laxative and to completely empty the bowel prior to a major surgery or colonoscopy. 
Madeleine (25113041) :- don't have anxiety
Madeleine (25113041) :- it's a joke\n
a (13434296) :- ya but I think most ppl don't have the magnesium count they require so I dont think it would hurt to pick up 
Madeleine (25113041) :- I'm not EL

diamond heart (24872539) :- apparently oysters are high in magnesium

diamond heart (24872539) :- supposedly Jamie
Madeleine (25113041) :- that sounds bad Jamie
diamond heart (24872539) :- yes I like oysters as long as they're not smoked
Madeleine (25113041) :- not worth it
Saturn (19364487) :- Magnesium citrate is generally not a harmful substance, but care should be taken by consulting a healthcare professional if any adverse health problems are suspected or experienced.  Extreme magnesium overdose can result in serious complications such as slow heart beat, low blood pressure, nausea, drowsiness, etc
a (13434296) :- I mean horniness is sometimes a hindrance

Have you been here before?\nMan: No, this is my first time. \nReceptionist: I see.  Well, do you want to have the full argument, or were you thinking of taking a course?\nMan: Well, what would be the cost?\nReceptionist: Well, It's one pound for a five minute argument, but only eight pounds for a course of ten. \nMan: Well, I think it's probably best if I start with the one and then see how it goes from there, okay?\nReceptionist: Fine.  I'll see who's free at the moment.
