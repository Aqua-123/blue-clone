Saturn (24897500) :- currently DMs are subject to risk of total crash
Me (16179602) :- this was 1yr ago 
Saturn (24897500) :- however Main Search has just been restored
Saturn (24897500) :- the karma nightmare has been almost eradicated
Saturn (24897500) :- the website is being stablisied by degrees
Saturn (24897500) :- this is all down to new management
Me (16179602) :- yeah ppl used karma to ban ppl 
Me (16179602) :- so the management is changed 
Saturn (24897500) :- yes
Saturn (24897500) :- so many nice people banned and eliminated
Saturn (24897500) :- it was a very bad time
Saturn (24897500) :- the yellow bots have left so only the trivial girl bots remain
Me (16179602) :- that why i left  
Befalling Square (24897404) :- sad
Me (16179602) :- bots destroyed this site

Saturn (24897500) :- karma exploits nearly destroyed it
<3 (24708860) :- right
Saturn (24897500) :- remarkably nasty people nearly destroyed it
Me (16179602) :- still remember that accident that caused banning the pics 
<3 (24708860) :- not the negligence from the owner 
Saturn (24897500) :- illegal activities must have come very close to destroying it
Me (16179602) :- so karma exploit still around? 
Saturn (24897500) :- and might still do so
Saturn (24897500) :- accident?
Saturn (24897500) :- looked pretty deliberate

Saturn (24897500) :- the executable  pics version was fixed long ago
Saturn (24897500) :- the one MAJOR FIX by previous management
Me (16179602) :- how about karma exploit 
Saturn (24897500) :- the overall karma excesses were fixed maybe a month ago
Saturn (24897500) :- there are too many karma exploits to go into i fear
Saturn (24897500) :- and i dont suppose we have seen the last of them
Me (16179602) :- what ar those
Saturn (24897500) :- youd have to ask the coding experts
Saturn (24897500) :- but best leave it alone
Saturn (24897500) :- you really think that outrageous and disgusting episode with pics was an accident?
Me (16179602) :-  they need to remove karma shit if they want this place to be better 
Saturn (24897500) :- they have almost totally removed it in practice
Me (16179602) :- yes it was 
Saturn (24897500) :- you will rarely see any karma happening just now
Saturn (24897500) :- well i dont see how someone can carpet the place in pics accidentally really
Me (16179602) :- it's not an accident in that way 
Me (16179602) :- i mean it was delebrate
