Cryo(22783061) :-the words reorder,order,where,find_by were vuilnerable in those versions for sql injections
Cryo(22783061) :-SQL injection vulnerability in the find_by method in Ruby on Rails 5.1.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the name parameter. NOTE: The vendor disputes this issue because the documentation states that this method is not intended for use with untrusted input.
Cryo(22783061) :-SQL injection vulnerability in the where method in Ruby on Rails 5.1.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the id parameter.

Cryo(22783061) :-its teh pramaneter and command thats different
Harenoir(11427049) :-yes that
Cryo(22783061) :-Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the quote_table_name method in the ActiveRecord adapters in activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/ in Ruby on Rails before 2.3.13, 3.0.x before 3.0.10, and 3.1.x before 3.1.0.rc5 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via a crafted column name.

Harenoir(11427049) :-hm...
Cryo(22783061) :-Null (-2.35K) / 1 year\n-10k would be more impressive
