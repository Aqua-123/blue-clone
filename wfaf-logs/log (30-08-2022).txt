Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- among various other hilarious issues
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- o. o
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- yeah, I managed to fix the /usr/bin thing
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- that's good
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- mm
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- kinda hard though, given what that directory contains
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- there should be triple confirmation upon deleting files
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- not if you're running your script as sudo
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- which I had to, because it uses debootstrap
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- . . . . 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- if you're root in a terminal session, rm -rf /
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- you can still ask for confirmation
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- will delete everything
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I probably can
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- guess it can't nowadays
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- to be fair, I could put a check in
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- didn't think about it, it was a relative path issue
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- either way, solved the problem
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, attention whore! Welcome to WFAF! Welcome to the place where your dreams will come true~
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- now building the image in docker
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- so if it scrambles the container, not an issue
Lumi (16008266) :- Hi, attention whore! I'm afraid they aren't your friend yet, you can always try again!
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- right
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- at least that way I don't run the risk of accidently nuking my tablet
Lumi (16008266) :- Hi again, attention whore, don't feel bad, they'll accept one day. . .  hopefully!
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- which would be an issue, because I don't have any external storage to use to recover
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- guess you should prepare at least one, just in case
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I don't have any, remember where I am
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- arch taught me to keep arch bootable usb stick with me
attention whore (25469022) :- what 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- to be fair, this is usually fine
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- debian
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- boooriiiing
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- with a custom kernel
attention whore (25469022) :- hi
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- I'm planning to install gentoo (again)
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- hi, living up to your name
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- on my second machine
attention whore (25469022) :- hru
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I'm running debian across the board
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- mostly with modded kernels though
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- btw, do you have any ideas of what to do with a second machine? server? cloud?
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- you can't really run your own private cloud or cluster with one machine
Lumi (16008266) :- SCP-1689 would make for a lot of . . .  Chipz.  ~*
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- if you have a bunch of spare drives lying around I'd get an ex-enterprise RAID card
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and running trueNAS or something
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- nope, just a small ssd on it
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- otherwise, having a machine you can experiment on is useful
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- install it and setup a clean system, image the drive
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and then use it for messing around
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- when you're done with a project (or you've scrambled the OS)
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- just image it back
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- true, won't f up my work on this machine
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- or or, if it's got a few cores and reasonable RAM
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- run VSXi or ProxMox on it
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and use it as a host for VMs which you can break
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- o. o
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- both are free
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- for double safety?
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- also for flexibility, you can put whatever OSs you want in VMs
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- if for some reason you need a Windows NT image for reasons
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- even macos?
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- Mac I'm not so sure
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- possibly
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- was a pain running it
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- even on windows
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- apparently you can install macOS 12 on VSXi
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- not sure I'd want to try it though
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- not sure anyone wants to try it though
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- no, also not sure really why you'd want to
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- tbh, installing macos on non-mac metal was popular here
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Sniffing Pyramid! Welcome to WFAF! Welcome to the place where your dreams will come true~
Lumi (16008266) :- Hi, Sniffing Pyramid! I'm afraid they aren't your friend yet, you can always try again!
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- had to work in swift
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- for a bit
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- ouch
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- was fine afterall
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- could never get behind developing for apple, all the stuff they wanted from you before you can debug stuff
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- certificates and code signing and bleh
Lumi (16008266) :- Our favorite Blue greeter is here!
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Pikachu! Welcome to WFAF! Welcome to the place where your dreams will come true~
Lumi (16008266) :- SCP-1689 would make for a lot of . . .  Chipz.  ~*
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- shrug
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- wasn't really a huge project, just a small part of it
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- never got into details
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- plus not like macos is any good besides looking cool
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- (had it on my non-mac machine)
Lumi (16008266) :- I've been up for 1 hours and 35 minutes
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Jamie ''Yowzah'' MkIIb! Welcome to WFAF! Welcome to the place where your dreams will come true~
Lumi (16008266) :- 42 coins added to the fountain, there are now 58138 coins in the fountain.  Thanks for the support! ^^
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- is jamie sending something or it's lumi acting on her own?
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- lumi is acting on her own
diamond heart (25138230) :- lumi send interrupting cow
Lumi (16008266) :- Image: i. imgur. com/uZYIyIW. jpeg
Lumi (16008266) :- Image: i. imgur. com/qFFTlHQ. jpeg
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- well, lumi isn't acting on me
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- that's usually a sign her guardian is around
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- aaand crap
diamond heart (25138230) :- pokes teri
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- build failed :(
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- :(
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- 21 minutes in, could not find libgpiod
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- which means I've spelled it wrong again
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- happens
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- mhm, one moment, editing scripts. . . 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- grr
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- so
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- apparently libgpiod
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- is actually gpiod (binaries)
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- libgpiod*2*
diamond heart (25138230) :- is jamie hacking the mainframe
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- shared libraries
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- yes dio
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and libgpiod-dev
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- for the love of god, pick ONE NAME
Lumi (16008266) :- Hi, Jamie ''Yowzah'' MkIIb! I'm afraid they aren't your friend yet, you can always try again!
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- so it's gpiod and libgpiod-dev?
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- no, I need the shared libraries too, so it's actually all 3
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- common practice to skip the lib prefix on binary packages
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- deletes docker container
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- AGAIN
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- pat pat
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- you'll get there
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- ok, here we go again
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- ~21 minutes
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- not that bad
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- this is attempt #5 using docker containers
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and something like attempt #16 overall
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- may have been at this all day
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and most of yesterday
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- using a touchscreen tablet with no keyboard or mouse doesn't help
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- what else can you do now?
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- while it's building? not a lot, being here with youtube in the background is about the limit for the CPU in this
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- hence the 21-minute build and not the ~2-5 minutes I'd expect on an actual computer
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- I mean these days
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- oh
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- given I've literally run out of things I want to watch more or less
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- random little software doodles are about all I can do
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and I've got to keep in practice somehow
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Green Ewok! Welcome to WFAF! Welcome to the place where your dreams will come true~
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- a donut shaped code to display a spinning donut
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- you're aware I'm not a graphics coder, right? my specialism is networking, datacenter and sysops
Lumi (16008266) :- Hi, Green Ewok! I'm afraid they aren't your friend yet, you can always try again!
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- didn't knew
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- to be fair, my actual job involves very little coding
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- that's good if you don't like coding
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I do work with some of our coding teams when I'm not deployed to a job, for lack of a better term
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and I code as a hobby
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Mars Donkey! Welcome to WFAF! Welcome to the place where your dreams will come true~
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- most of the things I write are little scripts and helper apps to make certain jobs easier
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- I guess you're using C/C++
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- C
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- and bash ofc
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- don't touch C++ if I can avoid it
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- lots of bash
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- lot of C# if I'm coding at home
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- python? java?
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- python is in the same bucket as C++ for me
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- the no thanks bucket
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- java is basically c# with a different runtime
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- or vice versa I guess, given java was born first
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- python is more like: I should do something and don't want to spend time on it
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I use C or C# for that
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- depending on what it is
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- writing into excel
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- c#
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- given both are micro$oft products
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- lol
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- that's the nice thing about c#, nuget
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- found it really hard to get to edit excel in C
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- packages to do everything
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- yeah, C you'd have trouble
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- actually not I guess these days, you'd just output as an open document format rather than excel
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- not as elegant as grabbing a package from nuget and just outputting
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- well, guess I'm dumb then
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- the last time I tried I failed
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- to be fair, the C approach would suck
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- for something like that I'd use C#, someone will have done the read and write a *%2Exlsx file work for you
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I guess python will have a module for that
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I just don't like python's syntax
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- guess would be easier in python
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- mm. . .  I just prefer {} ;
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- to def: <newline> <whitespace> if thing: <newline> <two whitespace> etc etc
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- actually it's tabs but yeah
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- when you need A3 landscape pages to show your code, time to stop using whitespace as a delimiter
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- got the idea
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- yeah
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- not a fan
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- the code looks cleaner as for me
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I guess it's what you're used to
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and I know python is used a lot for data processing
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- just
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- meh
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- probably, I did more python than C#
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I'm a strongly-typed, clear delimiter kinda person
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- is8
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- is*

Lumi (16008266) :- Hi, Green Ewok! I'm afraid they aren't your friend yet, you can always try again!
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- guess it's a use-case thing too, the code I oversee at work is mostly C because it's OS code
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- the stuff I do at home is embedded, lot of AVR stuff
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- so that's C too
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and the C# is what I learned first
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- lucky you, I learned pascal first -_-
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- pascal?
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- pascal abc
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- who uses pascal these days?
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- schools
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- but
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- whyyy??
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- to f us up
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- like, teach your kids something they might actually use
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- to be fair, there is an IL compiler for delphi
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- I mean, what can someone teach if they know nothing
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- python
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- enough resources out there for that
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- or C#, you can build unity games with that
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- BuT iS nOt iN ThE BoOk
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- complete with free for education full 0-to-full-games courses and materials
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- to be fair one of the professors on my masters was a FORTRAN kinda person
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- but that's because he had an IBM mainframe in the basement he liked to tinker with
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- I bet it wasn't the only thing he had in the basement
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- no, it was
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- damn thing took up the entire basement
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- >. >
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- still sus
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- it was, if I recall
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- an IBM 1401
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- or was it a 1501?
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- must be 1401
Lumi (16008266) :- Hi again, Green Ewok, don't feel bad, they'll accept one day. . .  hopefully!
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- probably was
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- well. . .  not that big
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- all I remember is it had a bunch of big reel-to-reel tape units, a couple of punchcard reader/writers
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and a couple of insanely loud continuous-feed printers
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- scary machine
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- half the tape drives didn't work because they had vacuum issues 
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- I wonder how people used to code those days
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- punchcards
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- I mean yeah
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- also
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- 26 minutes in
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- implodes
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- imagine writing your code in binary
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- it had a language, basically some kind of assembly if I recall
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and I remember clearly he had a FORTRAN compiler tape for it
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- ofc it did, you wrote that on the paper
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- so you loaded the FORTRAN compiler from the tape
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- . . . . 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- then you could read the program in from punchcards
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- wait over lunch while it compiled it
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and then you could run it
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- one of the test programs had it doing matrix floating-point math
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- which was geological time levels of slow
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Jeffeber! Welcome to WFAF! Welcome to the place where your dreams will come true~
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- I heard someone told us you wrote your program on the paper and sent it to get the punchcards
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- because no floating point unit, hell the thing was older than the IEEE standard for floating-point
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- that would be how it might work when the system was new, yes
Pikachu (25308787) :- Pika pii~
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- you'd have a printed listing of your program
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and you'd submit it as a job
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- then some intern would sit and punch the cards, feed them to the computer
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and you'd get a print-out back in a couple of days with the result
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- either the output from your program, or some kind of error
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Winding Wookiee! Welcome to WFAF! Welcome to the place where your dreams will come true~
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- right
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- awful times
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- eh, to be fair
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- I bet a huge stack of punchcards can now be done in max 10 lines of python code
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- punchcards weren't that inefficient
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- especially if it was assembly
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- in practice your computer is just reading punchcards right now, just out of RAM rather than actual cards with holes in them
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- but it's doing it faster, plus telling what and how to read is more optimized for devs
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- to be fair it's been a while since I operated that mainframe
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- but
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- if I recall
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- the entire stack was read into memory
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and then it would execute from there
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I don't think it was read card-by-card
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- in fact
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I know it wasn't
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- because
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- you could load a program to punch more cards
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- oh
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and the reader could do one or the other, but not both at once
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- so it'd read the stack in
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- then it could write a new stack
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- well. .  still no multithreading
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- multithreading?
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- nope!
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- if I recall, the CPU clock was in kilohertz
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- speeed
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- lol, and up to 16,000 6-bit character memory too
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- think the one we operated was 8K
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- tbh
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- I think limitations made the programs better
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- now a game can be 100Gb and have nothing good in it
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- yeah, I must admit
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I was a playstation person up to PS3, I still have my fat original PS2

Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I would suggest that it's either working in one of two ways
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- one, someone's written a python interpreter in JS
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- most likely
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- which I imagine would be roughly continental drift slow

Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- you're actually talking to a python instance (probably in a docker or kubernetes container or something) on their server
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and something is piping your console back and forth
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- probably a websocket

Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- those generally spun up a process for you on their server and piped your input to it
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- websockets to a wrapper over the python cli
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- hm. .  like code wars
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- the wrapper served both as a way to interface with the websocket and as a filter to stop you doing computationally intensive/destructive things
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- right.  I train myself on code wars from time to time
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- even tho I suck
