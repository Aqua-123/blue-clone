Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I smell SCP
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and the sides of that storm are bigger than this planet
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- you can fit at least one earth per side
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- There's no honeycomb incentive
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- so perhaps it's something tidal
Saturn (19364487) :- One hypothesis, developed at Oxford University, is that the hexagon forms where there is a steep latitudinal gradient in the speed of the atmospheric winds in Saturn's atmosphere
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Well that tells me nothing
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- But I guess Saturn would have wind patterns just like Earth
Saturn (19364487) :- A 2020 mathematical study at the California Institute of Technology, Andy Ingersoll laboratory found that a stable geometric arrangement of the polygons can occur on any planet when a storm is surrounded by a ring of winds turning in the opposite direction to the storms itself, called an anticyclonic ring, or anticyclonic shielding
Saturn (19364487) :- Similar regular shapes were created in the laboratory when a circular tank of liquid was rotated at different speeds at its centre and periphery.  The most common shape was six sided, but shapes with three to eight sides were also produced. 
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Fun
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- What do you know
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- There wasn't really ever a justification to suspect aliens

Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- just really interesting
Saturn (19364487) :- A turbulent hexagon-shaped storm has been raging near Saturn's north pole for at least four decades - we first discovered it in 1981 during the Voyager mission.  Even with a front-row view from the Cassini probe however, details on Saturn's hexagon have been scant

毛唐  (25085438) :- Yes saturn?
<3 (25033006) :- ok
<3 (25033006) :- but when did i swear
Saturn (19364487) :- commonly regarded as blasphemous
<3 (25033006) :- that's not swearing
<3 (25033006) :- yes
<3 (25033006) :- but not a swear
Saturn (19364487) :- well try it in front of your mum :)
<3 (25033006) :- and i dont think that's a biblical reference. . . 
<3 (25033006) :- if anything it's breaking one of the first three commandments 
<3 (25033006) :- i forget which 
<3 (25033006) :- i think 3rd
Saturn (19364487) :- it refers to the central biblical character

<3 (25033006) :- im not in a hole
<3 (25033006) :- referencing the bible isn't blasphemy 
<3 (25033006) :- go take your meds
毛唐  (25085438) :- Jesus is the son of god and god himself
毛唐  (25085438) :- That doesnt make sense at all
<3 (25033006) :- yeah that's the theory
<3 (25033006) :- god is the father the son and the holy spirit
<3 (25033006) :- but also one and the same entity 
毛唐  (25085438) :- thats why I think the current christianity is corrupted
Saturn (19364487) :- Profanity is a socially offensive use of language,1 which may also be called cursing, cussing, swearing, or expletives.  Accordingly, profanity is language use that is sometimes deemed impolite, rude, indecent, or culturally offensive; in certain religions, it constitutes sin.  It can show a debasement of someone or something,2 or be considered an expression of strong feeling towards something.  Some words may also be used as intensifiers. 
<3 (25033006) :- mhm
<3 (25033006) :- again
<3 (25033006) :- where did i swear in that
Saturn (19364487) :- it then goes on to list the relevant words so im not gonna copy that into here :)
毛唐  (25085438) :- Having a son is a feature that humans have
毛唐  (25085438) :- that cant be related to God
Saturn (19364487) :- In every Australian state and territory it is a crime to use offensive, indecent or insulting language in or near a public place. 36 These offences are classed as summary offences.  This means that they are usually tried before a local or magistrates court.  Police also have the power to issue fixed penalty notices to alleged offenders. 37 It is a defence in some Australian jurisdictions to have a reasonable excuse to conduct oneself in the manner allege
<3 (25033006) :- tell that to god i guess
<3 (25033006) :- and sat
<3 (25033006) :- you're still not telling me where i sweared in what i said
毛唐  (25085438) :- I dont really believe in that theory
毛唐  (25085438) :- My God is different

<3 (25033006) :- where
Saturn (19364487) :- Swearing in public is an administrative crime in Russia.  However, law enforcement rarely applied onto swearing people.  Fine equals to 500-1000 roubles or even a 15 days arres

<3 (25033006) :- ok
<3 (25033006) :- still isn't a swear
<3 (25033006) :- it's a name of our lord and saviour
<3 (25033006) :- or of some hispanic dude
Saturn (19364487) :- most swear words have an alternative meaning
Saturn (19364487) :- arguably that is the whole point
<3 (25033006) :- anything can be used as an insult if you try hard enough
<3 (25033006) :- i wasn't insulting anyone
<3 (25033006) :- i used it as sort of a sigh if anything
<3 (25033006) :- cant you ever accept you were wrong . -. 
<3 (25033006) :- i didn't swear
<3 (25033006) :- i was rude, sure

<3 (25033006) :- well maybe shove that where the sun don't shine
<3 (25033006) :- jesus isn't a swear word
Saturn (19364487) :- or ask your priest about it
<3 (25033006) :- and my priest will tell me what i told you
<3 (25033006) :- it is sinful to take god's name in vain
