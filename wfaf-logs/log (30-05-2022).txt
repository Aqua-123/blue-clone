<3 (24540494) :- it isn't a webgame
Saturn (19364487) :- you could see what how-to geek says about it
<3 (24540494) :- i'll try to install flash related stuff i had before i reinstalled windows
Saturn (19364487) :- right
<3 (24540494) :- bc i didn't have actual flash when i ran the games
<3 (24540494) :- so idk
Saturn (19364487) :- i guess a third party site might have flash, but of course some third party sites are completely unsafe
<3 (24540494) :- can you make a decision for me.​.​.​

<3 (24540494) :- it's not a life or death decision 
Saturn (19364487) :- what are the options?
<3 (24540494) :- liquid metal or BLÅHAJ
<3 (24540494) :- one will make my laptop finally shut up when i'm trying to watch sexy fox ads 
<3 (24540494) :- and the other is soft and squishy 
Saturn (19364487) :- not sure i really understand those
<3 (24540494) :- well
Saturn (19364487) :- you do like soft squishy it seems
<3 (24540494) :- liquid metal 
<3 (24540494) :- in this case
<3 (24540494) :- works somewhat like thermal paste
<3 (24540494) :- except it's way better
Saturn (19364487) :- oh i see so it makes your laptop run better
Saturn (19364487) :- be more capable

<3 (24540494) :- i don't have performance issues
Saturn (19364487) :- well stops it overheating
<3 (24540494) :- i have my fan won\'t stop issue
<3 (24540494) :- it's not overheating either
Saturn (19364487) :- and overheating can cause pretty zeroed performance :)
<3 (24540494) :- it just can
<3 (24540494) :- t stay belove 40
<3 (24540494) :- below 
<3 (24540494) :- *
<3 (24540494) :- and when it gets above 40 the fans come on

Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Sayhisam! Welcome to the place where your dreams used to come true!~
