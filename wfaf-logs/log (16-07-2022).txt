Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- *could
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- odds are the really bad ones are using VPNs, or tor, or both
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- so pulling an IP would only get you the VPN server or tor exit node
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- neither of which are any help
Blue (21550262) :- WHat can we do with the ips tho either way?
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- ^ also that

Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- IPs are ephemeral, as far as I know you can't get a conviction based solely on an IP

Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- pass
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- if it's anything like Ellie's ticketing
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- all that happens is the report gets dumped into a list
<3 (24975157) :- isn't doxxing done through IPs as well. . . 
<3 (24975157) :- can't you find their address
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- sometimes
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- not easily these days
<3 (24975157) :- hm
<3 (24975157) :- welp
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- plus, again
<3 (24975157) :- im not nerdy enough for this ig :3
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- VPN or tor or both
<3 (24975157) :- yeah yeah
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I'm using a VPN, always have
<3 (24975157) :- just a theory
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- so the best you get is a datacenter in
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- one sec
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- Belgium, apparently
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- 
<3 (24975157) :- oh well

Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- ouch
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- that's pretty much what all cats do to me
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- don't know why
Blue (21550262) :- Hi, Jupiter Burger, welcome to WFAF ~*
Blue (21550262) :- You could maybe report to the uhhh vpn org and report for using their service for such stuff but yeah
<3 (24975157) :- bc they love you so much ofc u. u
<3 (24975157) :- i always bite the ones i love~
<3 (24975157) :- right but you'd still have only the VPN no?
<3 (24975157) :- VPN IP
<3 (24975157) :- you can't really tell who used it by that that's the whole idea isn't it?
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- that's my point
Blue (21550262) :- Yes but their vpn account might get suspended or something but again tor 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I doubt it, most VPN providers sell their product based on not being able to trace the users using it
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- mine does that
Blue (21550262) :- right
<3 (24975157) :- ig you'd have to have control over the site to do this
<3 (24975157) :- but isn't smth like
<3 (24975157) :- not allowing people who have a VPN to access a site 
<3 (24975157) :- a thing?
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- it can be done
<3 (24975157) :- i could've sworn i got kicked of some bc of a vpn
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- not easily
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- it's a fight all the time, VPN providers deliberately make it difficult
Blue (21550262) :- omegle kicks you off for vpns although im gonna guess that works by just flagging the ips of vpns 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- yeah, cloudflare has a similar service
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- it'll deny connections based on their list of known VPN endpoints
Blue (21550262) :- Hi, Jupiter Biscuit, welcome to WFAF ~*
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- so, VPN providers keep changing their endpoints
Blue (21550262) :- Hi again, Jupiter Biscuit, say 'what is wfaf' for more info ~*
Blue (21550262) :- constant game of tug of war
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- makes sense for the providers to do, after all nobody's going to buy their service if they can't access things
Blue (21550262) :- mhm
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- as far as a site like this goes
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- nobody cares enough about it
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I would guess it's using the free tier of cloudflare, so not much if any filtering going on
Blue (21550262) :- wasnt aware cloudfare offers a free tier as well
Blue (21550262) :- Considering that and that it uses the most basic tier of heroku no wonder its still up
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- yes cloudflare offers free coverage
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- free SSL too
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I use it for my private git reops
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- *repos
