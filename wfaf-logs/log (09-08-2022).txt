Spooky (24493506) :- the sun is getting farther away from Earth over time.  On average, Earth is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from the sun, according to NASA(opens in new tab).  However, its orbit is not perfectly circular; it's slightly elliptical, or oval-shaped.  This means Earth's distance from the sun can range from about 91. 4 million to 94. 5 million miles (147. 1 million to 152. 1 million km), NASA(opens in new tab) says. 
Saturn (19364487) :- is it
