Saturn (19364487) :- are you finding nice friends on Eme?
Bazinga (24889344) :- Cuz there's usually only one gc that everyone's in and you have no idea whats going on. 
Bazinga (24889344) :- Atleast with eme you could go to a less populated gc
Bazinga (24889344) :- Wait a sec brb in like 20 minutes
Saturn (19364487) :- well in Opal you can go to a less populated GC - a totally empty one :)
Saturn (19364487) :- in fact on Opal that's often the only option :)
Saturn (19364487) :- its arguably confusing that Opal has a random search, when there is no one on Opal so you can just go round all day in that :)
