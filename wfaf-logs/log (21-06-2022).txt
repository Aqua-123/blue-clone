Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- I am batman (whoosing noise)
Saturn (19364487) :- i dont remember batman in WFAF at all
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- same
Saturn (19364487) :- are you up to speed on what works in eme these days?
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- things work on eme?
Saturn (19364487) :- text chatting works
Saturn (19364487) :- the karma nightmare has almost been killed off
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- sounds dangerous
Saturn (19364487) :- previously people were forever getting banned
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- oh that
Saturn (19364487) :- worst cases for a year for doing nothing wrong
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- I've only managed to get  a 24 hour ban
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- haven't made it to 1 year yet
Saturn (19364487) :- thats the maximum ban now
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- oh
Saturn (19364487) :- year bans have been scrubbed
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- thank god
Saturn (19364487) :- and 1 day bans are very rare now
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- using minutes now?
Saturn (19364487) :- its much more difficult to ban people now
Saturn (19364487) :- so it rarely happens
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- I've been banned a couple times
Saturn (19364487) :- karma much above or below zero is very rare now
Saturn (19364487) :- plus or minus two is a lot now
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- oh
Saturn (19364487) :- recently?
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- yes
Saturn (19364487) :- in GC?
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- yup
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- got an 18 hour ban just recently
Saturn (19364487) :- there are a few things going in GC
Saturn (19364487) :- they are very specific
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- I heard Aqua is still scripting his bullshit
Saturn (19364487) :- an 18 hour ban not exist
Saturn (19364487) :- probably 18 one hour bans on top of each other
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- oh
Saturn (19364487) :- are you Eugene?
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- How can someone have scripts to this site? Its not very secure
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- no not eugene
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- I've met eugene
Saturn (19364487) :- ah ok
Saturn (19364487) :- you can have scripts to most any site these days
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- oh
Saturn (19364487) :- by its nature karma is not secure because it is for users to use
Saturn (19364487) :- as they wish
Saturn (19364487) :- email addresses and passwords are hopefully secure
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- Aqua gives people karma by the thousands
Saturn (19364487) :- theres no scripts for those
Saturn (19364487) :- well i havent seen that much karma under the new system
Saturn (19364487) :- minus fifteen is what i have been seeing
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- Callan doesn't own this site anymore right?
Saturn (19364487) :- thats the best guess
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- so, who the hell is running the show? lol
Saturn (19364487) :- someone else :)
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- very helpful lol

Sponge (23112433) :- Your  up  for it 
Saturn (19364487) :- what's that?
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- Tried to see who owns this site
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- that's just tech support
Saturn (19364487) :- once upon a time you could actually do that
Saturn (19364487) :- then people took all their details off
Sponge (23112433) :- what's your e-mail  addresses for the new YouTube channel 
Saturn (19364487) :- im not up for it thanks Sponge
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Male 35 UK! Welcome to WFAF! Welcome to the place where your dreams used to come true~

Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- take care Saturn
Saturn (19364487) :- you will see people in GC say stuff about the new site owners
Saturn (19364487) :- but what do they know?
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- true
Saturn (19364487) :- ok pointing coyote
Sponge (23112433) :- @pointing Coyote please join me 
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- I cant sing or compose music
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- @Sponge
Sponge (23112433) :- I just want to do a yt Chanel together it's not music 
Saturn (19364487) :- maybe the best way to ask about the site owners is to join Callan on instagram
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- I think Eugene pissed him off already
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- as per what he told me
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- Not touching that shark
Saturn (19364487) :- sounds about right
Sponge (23112433) :- Boys can u hang yourselves now 
Saturn (19364487) :- is certainly true callan became very disgruntled
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- He also harassed his wife  from what I'm told
Saturn (19364487) :- Sponge you are being rather odd
Saturn (19364487) :- maybe try your schtick in GC
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- Both have their accounts on private now
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- if it wasn't before
Saturn (19364487) :- Eugene has serious personal problems
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- poor guy
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- Hope he find help
Saturn (19364487) :- it seems to go beyond the whole trolling thing
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- He's been here a long time it seems
Saturn (19364487) :- he has?
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- idk
Saturn (19364487) :- he became noticealbe quite recently
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- oh
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- maybe not then
Saturn (19364487) :- Callan had a different bete-noire before
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- I joined back when pictures were around.  Bea and Zio clashed pretty much on the daily
Sponge (23112433) :- bye boys 
Saturn (19364487) :- bye Sponge
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- bye Sponge.  Good luck with your YT thing
Sponge (23112433) :- lie dead tonight 
Saturn (19364487) :- there seems to be a partly new cast in GC now
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- yes I noticed that too
Saturn (19364487) :- but still so toxic
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- some are bleeding into Opal
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- and vice versa
Saturn (19364487) :- and some got thrown off Opal
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- like Kurt lol
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- I dont think Opal truly bans you though
Saturn (19364487) :- well its done something noticeably effective
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- I got couldn't go on for like 3 days straight, and then I was able to get back on
Saturn (19364487) :- to a few people
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- it seems
Saturn (19364487) :- i think the banning on Opal uses a bit of intelligence unlike Eme
Saturn (19364487) :- so you can get back but you will likely be spotted
Saturn (19364487) :- its also so small you cant hide in the crowds
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- true
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- Null runs a tight ship
Saturn (19364487) :- his bans are dramatically effective
Saturn (19364487) :- zappppppppp and everything you ever wrote has gone
Saturn (19364487) :- you are just a grey blob
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- I've had that happen to me a couple of times 
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- I couldn't see my own texts
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- when I refreshed coudn't get back on
Saturn (19364487) :- mmm
Saturn (19364487) :- you wound up Null then
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- yeah.  I do some trolling and non-trolling on there
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- same with Eme
Saturn (19364487) :- mmm
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- I should really be focusing on life 
Saturn (19364487) :- also Null seems to have built up a small team
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- Just Gray I thought
Saturn (19364487) :- maybe it will last longer than Callans team
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- maybe
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Mercury Mallard! Welcome to WFAF! Welcome to the place where your dreams used to come true~
Saturn (19364487) :- i thought i saw a couple more
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- It was Gray and someone else I thought
Saturn (19364487) :- and after a few fiascos he has seemingly upgraded security quite effectively
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- yup.  
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- PLus its through Amazon so I mean
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- lot of tech there
Saturn (19364487) :- but he has to find a better way to gain new members than carpet bombing emewith spam
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- he carpet bombs eme?
Saturn (19364487) :- seems to have used every possible trick
Saturn (19364487) :- jumping across peoples feeds
Saturn (19364487) :- botting in random chaat
Saturn (19364487) :- covering every GC squad wall to wall in spam
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- hmm. . 
Saturn (19364487) :- he runs sophisticated spam bots in GC
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- Yes, I know.  lol
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- I test them out daily
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- lol
Saturn (19364487) :- mmm
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- seems to be a pattern though
Saturn (19364487) :- the usual battles continue as ever in GC\n
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- on Eme?
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- or on opal?
Saturn (19364487) :- on eme
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- yup
Saturn (19364487) :- spamming, bannine, new spamming etc
Saturn (19364487) :- permamuting :)
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- I feel like not everyone is using RxE for this
Saturn (19364487) :- default permamute on every new arrival could be good :)
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- would there be a waiting period?
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- like on Twitch
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- ?
Saturn (19364487) :- im thinking it would be instant
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- but how would you talk after?
Saturn (19364487) :- you unmute newcomers when you feel like it to check if they are sensible
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- oh
Saturn (19364487) :- rather than having to mute them when they arent
Saturn (19364487) :- it would work against new people sadly
Saturn (19364487) :- but it would make GC really peaceful
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- wouldn't new people just leave 
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- if they cant chat to others
Saturn (19364487) :- that is the risk
Saturn (19364487) :- would depend on people giving them a chance
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- good luck with that
Saturn (19364487) :- well its not gonna be me, its gonna be the GC regulars
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- GC Regulars? Then new people are def fucked
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- RIP
Saturn (19364487) :- when karma was a thing, often GC was set to autoban any newomer
Saturn (19364487) :- so that for sure discouraged new people
Saturn (19364487) :- things can only get bettt terrr
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- Should be a waiting room for new comers to chat in
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- then if things work out can be directed to GC
Lumi (16008266) :- Your friendly neighbourhood Saturn is here! *~~. 
Saturn (19364487) :- nice idea
Saturn (19364487) :- or very restricted chatting for a probation period
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- yes that too
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- Some discords do that
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- They allow some but not all
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Silver Ithorian! Welcome to WFAF! Welcome to the place where your dreams used to come true~
Lumi (16008266) :- Hi, Silver Ithorian! I'm afraid they aren't your friend yet, you can always try again!
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- I also feel like there are too many rooms
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- After Royal Squad, other rooms have 1, not sure what thats about
Saturn (19364487) :- seems to be a contagious disease
Saturn (19364487) :- far too many rooms in GCs
Saturn (19364487) :- just have one and expand to two when there is demand
Saturn (19364487) :- well they appear to have one
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- Some sites I've been on, have specific rooms for specific chats
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Kat! Welcome to WFAF! Welcome to the place where your dreams used to come true~
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- like one for weather, politics etc
Saturn (19364487) :- hopefully only for specific chats people actually care fro
Saturn (19364487) :- for
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- Ideally, it should be moderated, but I'm sure that would be a turn off
Saturn (19364487) :- well thats p ointless until you have enough people
Kat (24771608) :- hello
Pointing Coyote (24782007) :- true
