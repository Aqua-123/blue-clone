Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- still, not as stable as you'd expect
Shotty (25017558) :- Heyy uni
Venus Onix (25017523) :- hii
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and a lot of the compute cards have no physical outputs
‎ (24039236) :- hmhmm
Blue (21550262) :- Hello, Venus Onix, try asking 'what is wfaf' for more info ~*
Shotty (25017558) :- Heyy venus onix
Venus Onix (25017523) :- hi
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- because they're designed to either do purely CUDA compute or to run instanced VMs
‎ (24039236) :- right 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- which don't require a direct connection, its all over network
‎ (24039236) :- ooh right so just racks full of gpus 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- some of them, yes
‎ (24039236) :- connected over network 
Venus Onix (25017523) :- hiii
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- racks of many, many cores and many, many GPUs
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and terabytes of RAM
‎ (24039236) :- right 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- to be honest, I prefer that over racks full of disks
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- at least if you drop a compute node all you've done is dent the case and chip the floor
‎ (24039236) :- lol
Blue (21550262) :- Hi, Pikachu, welcome to WFAF ~*
Blue (21550262) :- Greetings diamond heart ~*
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- if you drop a storage node with actual spinning platters in it, you've just written it off
‎ (24039236) :- mhm
‎ (24039236) :- store a full game on volatile storage, that could be a fun experiment 
‎ (24039236) :- hmm
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- done it
‎ (24039236) :- owo
Blue (21550262) :- 0. \u200b0
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- not as fast as it sounds
‎ (24039236) :- oh 
‎ (24039236) :- damn
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I mean, don't get me wrong, it's pretty fast
‎ (24039236) :- hmhmm
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- but the issue is most volatile storage drivers don't allow execute-in-place
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- so you end up copying things around in RAM before something executes
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and that bottlenecks
‎ (24039236) :- ahh right 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- also depends on the game
diamond heart (24872539) :- I just lost the game
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- big games always end up copying stuff from RAM to GRAM
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- also, sorry diamond
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- my bad
‎ (24039236) :- hence the selling point of smart access memory by nvidia 
Shotty (25017558) :- lost which game?
diamond heart (24872539) :- the game
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- you still end up with an execute-in-place issue
Shotty (25017558) :- I wish i could see what you said
‎ (24039236) :- right 
‎ (24039236) :- fun though either way 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- true
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- plus you get bragging rights that you can run a AAA title from RAM
