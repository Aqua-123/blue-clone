Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- It's okay
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- look at the plastic plate behind the handle, it extends up offscreen, which would suggest another thing mounted above it
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- as most windows don't have a separate lock
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I go with door as my choice :)
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and yes, Jamie is tired, Jamie hasn't slept more than 4 hours unmedicated at a stretch in a while

Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- to be fair the bed is about as comfy as a hospital bed can be
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- sleeping with the EKG wires and oxygen is a little difficult
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- pats Jamie

<3 (25033006) :- and it's a fucking webp
<3 (25033006) :- why can't i send webps berry
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- online converter
<3 (25033006) :- ik. . . . . . . . . 
<3 (25033006) :- just
<3 (25033006) :- too much work
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- also that's a fair point berry
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- why no webp?
<3 (25033006) :- Image: i%2Eimgur%2Ecom/5OxEfzg%2Epng * See just a link? Get RxE 0. 11. 0+: github%2Ecom/Ritsu-Projects/Public-Releases/
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- hmm
<3 (25033006) :- it's too high up to be a door
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- perhapd
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- is it literally just because imgur doesn't do webp
<3 (25033006) :- plus cats aren't that big
<3 (25033006) :- so the surface
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- or because webp isn't in the list of allowed extensions?
<3 (25033006) :- has to be pretty close
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- could be on a chair
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- (or mime types)?
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- jamie, I have no clue right now
<3 (25033006) :- so it's at most a meter tall
<3 (25033006) :- there's no way that's a door
<3 (25033006) :- there's clearly no balcony outside of it
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- webp is an image as far as the browser is concerned
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- ok, so it's a window
<3 (25033006) :- and it's as high as the trees
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- and gifs work
<3 (25033006) :- huh
<3 (25033006) :- idk then
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- yeah, so either imgur doesn't like webps
<3 (25033006) :- bc whenever i try to send webp
<3 (25033006) :- it just gets stuck loading
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- or the uploady thing is rejecting it
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- Yeah
<3 (25033006) :- maybe smth on my end
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- that's imgur I think
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- no, does it to me too siimon
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- It doesn't have proper handling
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- For failed uploads
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- imgur doesn't list webp as supported
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- That would do it
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- although it doesn't explicitly say it isn't either, only GIFV is explicitly listed as unsupported
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- gifv is just mp4
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- and I've seen it on imgur. . . 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- apparently not *just*, because mp4 is supported
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- sigh
