hugo (25122362) :- hopefully this one lasts\n
Saturn (19364487) :- matt 2 had no support, training etc
Saturn (19364487) :- was a complete joke
hugo (25122362) :- does smoothwing have any of the mentioned?
Saturn (19364487) :- yes to become apparent
Saturn (19364487) :- however we have new management
Blue (21550262) :- Hi, hugo, welcome to WFAF ~*
Saturn (19364487) :- that may make all the difference
Saturn (19364487) :- the new management seems to do things properly
Saturn (19364487) :- not just break anything that causes an issue
F 23 Canada (16387709) :- Emerald has management?
Saturn (19364487) :- yes
Saturn (19364487) :- and now a moderator
Saturn (19364487) :- very interesting development
Saturn (19364487) :- there is also deletion of problem acccounts
F 23 Canada (16387709) :- Can't they just create new temp accounts when that happens?
Saturn (19364487) :- yes
Saturn (19364487) :- however that might change
F 23 Canada (16387709) :- That would be great if it did\n
Saturn (19364487) :- an obvious move would be to kill all temp accounts
F 23 Canada (16387709) :- True\n
Saturn (19364487) :- puts the whole enterprise on a more sound footing
Saturn (19364487) :- i believe it was once done before
hugo (25122362) :- it's so cold

diamond heart (24960047) :- Powering on a computer causes changes in temperature as well as voltage spikes, both of which can potentially hurt the circuitry.
