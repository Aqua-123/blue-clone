Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- might also want to think about how you're going to get your stuff (and your OS) from the hdd to the ssd
Not_jamz (14648841) :- I believe I have a separate slot on the laptop for the ssd 
Not_jamz (14648841) :- So I can run them both 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- that would be unusual
ㅤ  (24039236) :- you still would want your os on the ssd 
ㅤ  (24039236) :- so still want it moved
Not_jamz (14648841) :- Yea
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- also that, you can't just copy/paste your OS
ㅤ  (24039236) :- yes that
ㅤ  (24039236) :- wish it was that simple
Not_jamz (14648841) :- If only 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- sudo cp /dev/sda /dev/sdb

Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- dd
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- not really copy/pasting though
Not_jamz (14648841) :- But yeqh I'm probably going to be stuck with what I've got for now for a couple more years 
Not_jamz (14648841) :- It gets the job done atleast 
ㅤ  (24039236) :- you need the partition table copied first. . . . 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- that would copy the entire disk, partition table and all
ㅤ  (24039236) :- hh
ㅤ  (24039236) :- huh
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- if I tried /dev/sda1
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- then yeah
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- that'd be bad
ㅤ  (24039236) :- wouldnt it interfere if sizes are diff?
ㅤ  (24039236) :- copying a table of 1tb to 256 gigs
diamond heart (25138230) :- you can't move your os from a larger drive to a smaller one
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- if the destination is bigger you'd have to resize the partitions after copying
ㅤ  (24039236) :- is smaller
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- if the destination is smaller it's just not going to work
ㅤ  (24039236) :- right that
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- you'd have to make the partition table and then cp things around
ㅤ  (24039236) :- yeeeeee

Saturn (19364487) :- The Japanese don't care to. 
The Chinese wouldn't dare to,
Saturn (19364487) :- Hindoos and Argentines sleep firmly from twelve to one. 
Saturn (19364487) :- But Englishmen detest a siesta. 
Saturn (19364487) :- In the Philippines

To protect you from the glare.

Saturn (19364487) :- It's such a surprise for the Eastern eyes to see
That though the English are effete,
They're quite impervious to heat,
When the white man rides every native hides in glee,
Because the simple creatures hope he
Will impale his solar topee on a tree. 
Blue (21550262) :- I can see Saturn, Licking Tomato, Pikachu, -- (#earthling) and 2 peeps lurking ~*
Blue (21550262) :- I can see <3 (#siimon), Lumi lurking

The earth
That they give rise to such hilarity and mirth.
