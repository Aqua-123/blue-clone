Neptune Skunk (24050055) :- u mean karma farmers? Lil
Neptune Skunk (24050055) :- script users
Saturn (19364487) :- but there could be quite a few reasons for it
Neptune Skunk (24050055) :- aqua and harenoir do
Neptune Skunk (24050055) :- But this suspiscipis character #__ was in all chats at once.​ They're using scripts 
Saturn (19364487) :- if you get friendly with a few people, you might land up with someone who will help your karma
Neptune Skunk (24050055) :- I know, mostly strawberry or aqua or harenoir
Saturn (19364487) :- you dont need a script to be in all the chats at once
Saturn (19364487) :- you just join one by one

Neptune Skunk (24050055) :- They first farmed me down to 2808 lol
Neptune Skunk (24050055) :- -2808
Saturn (19364487) :- your karma will probably benefit one way or another
Neptune Skunk (24050055) :- Yes but, it's hard to be friendly with peope like aqua and harenoir because I've seen them act badly.​ Such as banning innocents
