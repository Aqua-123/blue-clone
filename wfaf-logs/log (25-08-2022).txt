Blue (21550262) :- Hi again, Venus Tomato, say 'what is wfaf' for more info ~*
diamond heart (25138230) :- ohh
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- I was thinking more about sen
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- though I'm not sure something 4-dimensional can have a negative length
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- well yes, there is that option too
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- but I'm not sure one could measure a female in such a manner
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- nor should someone want to, either
Blue (21550262) :- Hi, periwinkle, welcome to WFAF ~*
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- I mean as a relative from before

Blue (21550262) :- Hi, Silver Fish Fingers , welcome to WFAF ~*
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- if it's a relative measurement, surely it'd be a smaller number than -6
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- the average length is 5-6 in
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- so
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- -6 would be nothing at all
Blue (21550262) :- Hi again, Silver Fish Fingers , say 'what is wfaf' for more info ~*
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- how did we even get here?
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- . . . %2Ethat would be the point?
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- yes, but it wouldn't be nothing at all
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- because instead of, and pardon the language
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- instead of an outie she'd have an innie
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- that would also be at least that long
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- so a relative measurement of -8 -> -12
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- would be more accurate
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- again, how did we get here?
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- >. >
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- I was thinking about that as well, but we don't measure of how much some can take, right?
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- or I don't know the anatomy very well
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- and. . .  we got here because of karma
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- that was kind of my point earlier, generally we don't measure females like that
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- nor should we
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗" (18560513) :- i think there is such a method, but ok
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- possibly there is, but it's a lot more invasive than just holding a ruler in one hand and 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- well
