Lumi (16008266) :- Hi, \u200e! I'm afraid they aren't your friend yet, you can always try again!
Saturn Poppadom (24057302) :- Yeah you already said that 
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Idk! Welcome to the place where your dreams used to come true!~
Saturn Poppadom (24057302) :- but
Saturn Poppadom (24057302) :- theres no one here rn
Saturn Poppadom (24057302) :- ot when we were talking
Idk (22130896) :- hey
Saturn (19364487) :- hi idk
Saturn Poppadom (24057302) :- saturn there was no one else here when we we talking, so no need to keep it family friendly and nice lol
Saturn (19364487) :- welcome to WFAF
Saturn (19364487) :- again
Saturn (19364487) :- we always keep WFAF nice
Saturn (19364487) :- theres a million squads in GC for the other stuff
Blue (21550262) :- Theres always someone else there.​\u200b.​\u200b
Saturn (19364487) :- thanks blue
Blue (21550262) :- You're welcome :D
Saturn (19364487) :- that as well
Saturn Poppadom (24057302) :- Then u messed up earlier when u were discussing sex offenders and abusers with me ;)
Saturn (19364487) :- well no ones perfect
Saturn (19364487) :- i realised my mistake
Saturn Poppadom (24057302) :- A million squads? Don't joke.​ Lol.​ It's only ever 1 squad that is active.​ And only gets at most around 15 people
Saturn Poppadom (24057302) :- lol
Lumi (16008266) :- Hi again, Omnissiah, don't feel bad, they'll accept one day.​.​.​ hopefully!
Saturn (19364487) :- theres 24 or something that people happily fill up with all sorts of junk
Saturn (19364487) :- often the same junk across the whole lot
Saturn (19364487) :- sadly
Saturn (19364487) :- hi again omnissiah the quiet one
Saturn Poppadom (24057302) :- Saturn, they are all filled because whenever there is 0 people, then next person to join group chat it assigns them to a random squad.​ All the squads just display whatever was last said there.​ It's just the main chat jumping around randomly 
Saturn Poppadom (24057302) :- don't pretend u don't know how emerald works
Saturn (19364487) :- incorrect
Saturn Poppadom (24057302) :- I'm not
Saturn (19364487) :- when anyone joins GC it always allocates them to the same squad
Saturn (19364487) :- so one squad gets super busy aand the rest super empty
Saturn Poppadom (24057302) :- If there's 0 people on emerald, I refresh and it sends me to a random squad 
Saturn (19364487) :- ok
Saturn (19364487) :- and then you get insta banned
Saturn Poppadom (24057302) :- I'm not worng
Saturn Poppadom (24057302) :- im not incorrect lol
Saturn (19364487) :- ok
Saturn Poppadom (24057302) :- im just saying that the squads all are filled with whatever was last spoken there
Saturn (19364487) :- yes
Saturn (19364487) :- and i stand by what i said
Saturn (19364487) :- because a lot of people make a habit of writing the same stuff into every squad
Saturn Poppadom (24057302) :- And it's because it randomly assigns u to a squad and one squad eventually becomes the main chat 
Saturn Poppadom (24057302) :- Yes Saturn I'm aware of the spammers 
‏ (14267520) :- aka all gcs are spammed with same shit
Saturn Poppadom (24057302) :- We all know that
