Saturn (19364487) :- in the beginnign there were no greeters
Harenoir (11427049) :- with copy paste
Saturn (19364487) :- the likes of unknown girl used to pop into WFAF and do stuff
Harenoir (11427049) :- huh
Spookyy (20199174) :- huh ???
Harenoir (11427049) :- i haven't seen here in a long while
Harenoir (11427049) :- her*

Spookyy (20199174) :- she is unknown and wierd
Spookyy (20199174) :- hehe
Harenoir (11427049) :- lol
Spookyy (20199174) :- i saw her a week ago
Spookyy (20199174) :- 2 weeks ago
Harenoir (11427049) :- i see
Spookyy (20199174) :- somewhere around there
Spookyy (20199174) :- yea
Saturn (19364487) :- i expect she is missing that cute clock picture
Saturn (19364487) :- and probably still meeting lots of people
Harenoir (11427049) :- she already had around 10k friends
Spookyy (20199174) :- .​ .​ .​
Harenoir (11427049) :- if her screenshot was true, ofc
Saturn (19364487) :- i guess she broke her friends list long before i even had one
Harenoir (11427049) :- oof
Harenoir (11427049) :- maybe
Saturn (19364487) :- too many invites for emerald to handle
Harenoir (11427049) :- now i'm actually wondering if his account managed to handle all those people.​.​.​
Harenoir (11427049) :- her*
Saturn (19364487) :- i think i noticed a few people who said they couldnt friend because they had too many and it stopped working
Harenoir (11427049) :- mhm
Spookyy (20199174) :- what is the limit?
Harenoir (11427049) :- i've met peopel with 600-700-1k friends
Saturn (19364487) :- unknown girl used to show off those mod options too
Harenoir (11427049) :- ah yes
Harenoir (11427049) :- her profile with mod button
Saturn (19364487) :- at best it would take ages to get to a friend going eight at a time
Saturn (19364487) :- only the ones who replied would be at all practical to message
Harenoir (11427049) :- let's see
Saturn (19364487) :- after sixty friend they run off the page too
Harenoir (11427049) :- if you want to reach the bottom of a 10k friend list
Harenoir (11427049) :- 8 at a time, that'd be.​.​.​
Harenoir (11427049) :- 1,2k times you have to press the load more button
Saturn (19364487) :- and the moment you do it quickly you get a 503 error
Harenoir (11427049) :- true
Harenoir (11427049) :- or a 403
Saturn (19364487) :- emerald is quite sensitive about that button
Saturn (19364487) :- yes maybe that one
Harenoir (11427049) :- and then it gets all laggy
Saturn (19364487) :- yes
Saturn (19364487) :- ive never seen anyone explain why you have to do those careful pauses on certain buttons
Harenoir (11427049) :- surprisingly, me neither
Harenoir (11427049) :- i just have to be careful when doing stuff
Harenoir (11427049) :- ig that's just emerald being emerald
Saturn (19364487) :- i think it often fools newcomers who then think it doesnt work at all, but in time evewyone just gets used to it
Harenoir (11427049) :- for the people who stay on here long enough, sure
Harenoir (11427049) :- they all get used to it, eventually
Saturn (19364487) :- reminds me of those panicky cries - how can i get rid of a friend!
Harenoir (11427049) :- friend list -> open profile -> delete
Harenoir (11427049) :- but of course, easy to say, hard to explain
Saturn (19364487) :- and not at all obvious to many newcomers who really needed it
Harenoir (11427049) :- and then the usual how can i remove a non friend
Saturn (19364487) :- yes :)
Harenoir (11427049) :- and we were like i\'m sorry but you just can\'t
Harenoir (11427049) :- unless they accept ofc
Saturn (19364487) :- you just make a whole new account :)
