Once your meat is slightly brown add the vegetables/fruit and once there's enough water to cover them, add about 1/2 a cup to one cup of extra water.  Cover and cook on the low setting for 8 hours hours, when you get home add some Cabernet Sauvignon if you have it

diamond heart (24960047) :- I read that conversation and still don't understand it
diamond heart (24960047) :- might need to take a whole course on the subject
Saturn (19364487) :- its on a youtube video
diamond heart (24960047) :- there's numbers in a box and each prisoner has a number and they have to pick their number at random from the box and all of them have to do it then they can go free
diamond heart (24960047) :- ?
Saturn (19364487) :- yes
diamond heart (24960047) :- it's kinda like the monkeys on typewriters doing the complete works of shakespeare
Saturn (19364487) :- 100 prisonsers, each numbered, and each number in one of 10 boxes
Alure (21388579) :- how do you not understand that?
Saturn (19364487) :- they get to check 50 out of 100 boxes
diamond heart (24960047) :- well apparently I do understand it alure and I thought it was more complicated than it is
diamond heart (24960047) :- or I was close to understanding
diamond heart (24960047) :- because saturn is explaining more now and I'm getting confused again
Coconut_Princess (18133491) :- o. 0
Coconut_Princess (18133491) :- i think we should all just sit down
Saturn (19364487) :- so each of 100 prisoners checks 50 of 100 boxes for their own number
Coconut_Princess (18133491) :- and drink some tea
diamond heart (24960047) :- am sitting
diamond heart (24960047) :- had tea earlier

Green Mon Calamari (25249256) :- ?
Coconut_Princess (18133491) :- prisoners 
Saturn (19364487) :- so if they do it randomly
Saturn (19364487) :- chance of one prisoner doing it is 1/2
Green Mon Calamari (25249256) :- what have i entered
Saturn (19364487) :- chance of 100 doing it
Saturn (19364487) :- is 1/2 to the power 100
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Venus Fish! Welcome to WFAF! Welcome to the place where your dreams will come true~

Saturn (19364487) :- one by one
diamond heart (24960047) :- umm ok
Saturn (19364487) :- then everything is put back for the next prisoner
Saturn (19364487) :- no communication during the exercise
diamond heart (24960047) :- 50 boxes each with 2 numbers inside
Saturn (19364487) :- no
Saturn (19364487) :- 100 boxes with 1 number inside

diamond heart (24960047) :- and you can't read it anymore
Saturn (19364487) :- noooooooooo
Saturn (19364487) :- chips was on about this
diamond heart (24960047) :- lol
Saturn (19364487) :- reckoned you could see the footsteps
diamond heart (24960047) :- see footsteps?
diamond heart (24960047) :- has it been snowing inside the prison
Saturn (19364487) :- maybe its dusty
diamond heart (24960047) :- hmm
Saturn (19364487) :- or they worn away the floor
Saturn (19364487) :- anyway chance of one prisoner is 0. 5
Saturn (19364487) :- chance of 100 prisoners is 0. 5 X 0. 5 100 times
Saturn (19364487) :- which is not a lot
diamond heart (24960047) :- same chances of flipping heads 100 times in a row
Saturn (19364487) :- yes exactly
Saturn (19364487) :- buttttt
Saturn (19364487) :- they can do better
Saturn (19364487) :- there is  abetter plan
diamond heart (24960047) :- start a riot
diamond heart (24960047) :- take out the guards
Saturn (19364487) :- noooooooooooooooooo
diamond heart (24960047) :- use the boxes as weapons
Saturn (19364487) :- is to do with how you choose which box to look in
Saturn (19364487) :- you dont just randomly pick 50 boxes
Saturn (19364487) :- or take the first 50
diamond heart (24960047) :- what do you do instead
Saturn (19364487) :- you not gonna believe it
Saturn (19364487) :- here goes
Saturn (19364487) :- the prisoner looks in the first box and looks at the number
Saturn (19364487) :- then he goes to the box with that number and looks
Saturn (19364487) :- and again the number he gets out, then he goes to that box and looks
Saturn (19364487) :- and so on
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Magenta Monkey! Welcome to WFAF! Welcome to the place where your dreams will come true~
Lumi (16008266) :- Hi, Magenta Monkey! I'm afraid they aren't your friend yet, you can always try again!
Lumi (16008266) :- Hi again, Magenta Monkey, don't feel bad, they'll accept one day. . .  hopefully!
Magenta Monkey (25250131) :- hi
Saturn (19364487) :- so maybe he looks in box 1 and gets 64
Saturn (19364487) :- so he goes to box 64
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Nick31! Welcome to WFAF! Welcome to the place where your dreams will come true~
Lumi (16008266) :- Hi, Nick31! I'm afraid they aren't your friend yet, you can always try again!
Saturn (19364487) :- maybe he then gets number 37 so he goes to box 37 and looks 
Saturn (19364487) :- etc
Lumi (16008266) :- Hi again, Nick31, don't feel bad, they'll accept one day. . .  hopefully!
Saturn (19364487) :- hi magenta  monkey
Saturn (19364487) :- and apparently the prisoners then have a one in three chance
Saturn (19364487) :- of total success
Saturn (19364487) :- i made a mistake
diamond heart (24960047) :- oh
Saturn (19364487) :- the prisoner goes to the box with HIS NUMBER on first
Saturn (19364487) :- not the first box
Saturn (19364487) :- that is important
diamond heart (24960047) :- hm
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Jupiter Gamorreans! Welcome to WFAF! Welcome to the place where your dreams will come true~
Saturn (19364487) :- so it is all down to loops
Saturn (19364487) :- the boxes and the numbers form loops
Saturn (19364487) :- eventually you get back to the box you started
Saturn (19364487) :- so the prisoner will find his own number in the last box in the loop
Saturn (19364487) :- if all 100 boxes form a loop then bad news
Saturn (19364487) :- everyone will fail
Saturn (19364487) :- but itshighly likely that there are three or four smaller loops
Saturn (19364487) :- in which case the loop will end before 50 boxes and the prsioner will get his number
Saturn (19364487) :- and the same for all the others
diamond heart (24960047) :- ok
Saturn (19364487) :- its really fascinating i think
Saturn (19364487) :- and has consequnces for those kind of searches
Saturn (19364487) :- you serously dont want to do those type of searches randomly
Saturn (19364487) :- where you basically have a big set and it has been shuffled up
Saturn (19364487) :- for example a pack of cards is 52 cards
Saturn (19364487) :- you can order them by suit then by number
Saturn (19364487) :- you shuffle them up
Saturn (19364487) :- you want to find the queen of spades
Saturn (19364487) :- you look at the card which would be queen of spades if they were in order
Saturn (19364487) :- maybe you get six of clubs
Saturn (19364487) :- you then look at the one which would be six of clubs if in order
Saturn (19364487) :- and so on
Saturn (19364487) :- it fomrs a loop
Saturn (19364487) :- you get the card you want at the end of the loop
Lumi (16008266) :- Sir This recruit tactically acquired the fig bars sir~
diamond heart (24960047) :- then what do you do when the loop is complete
Alure (21388579) :- I should get some fig bars
Alure (21388579) :- loop?
Saturn (19364487) :- then you have found the card you wanted
Saturn (19364487) :- and there are likely three or four loops
Alure (21388579) :- oh, card tricks
Saturn (19364487) :- so you dont have to search that many cards
Alure (21388579) :- I use to do those but I can't remember how

Saturn (19364487) :- and will work the same for any card in the pack
diamond heart (24960047) :- bit hard to wrap my head around
Saturn (19364487) :- yes
Saturn (19364487) :- anyway the youtube thing is nice
diamond heart (24960047) :- lumi send 100 prisoners
