Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- with opi
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- was ready to talk more now
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- ouch
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- my responses were brief as you saw
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- you'll still have time to talk with them I hope
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- next year sure
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- maybe tomorrow
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- its the opportunity 
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- i could probably look for%2Ethem
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- but then its awkward
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- them showing up works best
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- aren't they on discord?
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- as is the case with many friends
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- now, before i forget the balance 
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- but you're done with your money :D
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Yes, but I didn't enter it into the spreadsheet until now
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Anyways, what good is it to me if they're on Discord
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- you can message them there perhaps?
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- If I go against my principles, sure
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- But since being directly in touch with them is no good as I said
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- and what's that principle?
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- They're not close enough to me as a friend and I'd rather they came by
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- It'd get awkward trying to force conversations when the most value is found when we haven't talked for a long time 
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- ah, I totally feel you
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- that principle is not to avoid non-privacy respecting services
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- . -. 
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- ?
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- kinda confusing with double negation
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- that principle is to prefer privacy respecting services 
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- like libreoffice?
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Sure
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- That falls more under using free and open source software
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- aka FOSS
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- but it contributes to privacy as well
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- hmm. . .  wonder how much you've been replaces with FOSS apps
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Using Gmail + Libreoffice is worse then Signal + Microsoft Office
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- replaced*
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Can you rephrase that question 
Blue (21550262) :- Hi, Turquoise Hypno, welcome to WFAF ~*
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- I mean how many apps you've been replaced with FOSS ones
Turquoise Hypno (24983115) :- hi
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- hi
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Oh
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Well most
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- But you mean, you\'ve replaced
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- 
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- ooo
Blue (21550262) :- 0. \u200b0
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- like replacing ms office with libreoffice
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- using FOSS ones instead of proprietary ones
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Non-foss on my phone are in my work profile only
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Two apps exactly
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- even play store?
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I don't use Google Play Store
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- fdroid then?
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- My phone is from Google but no Google remains on it
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Yes
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Just two apps related to transport that are proprietary
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- isn't it hard to use it like that?
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- nothing on my Linux that's proprietary which is what I used  everyday
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- use*
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Meh not really
Blue (21550262) :- Hi, Dawg, im a Teen Boy, welcome to WFAF ~*

Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Sharky, ask me and I'll tell you alternatives
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- hmmm
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- like a todo list
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I don't use that
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- But you have OpenTodoList
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- I found a few apps that are quite useful for managing the groceries and sleep schedule
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Simple Notes has todo lists
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Sleep schedule apps also exist
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- camera?
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- If you really prefer the app, you can use Aurora Store to get it from Google Play.  It'll also tell you what kind of trackers it has
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Cameras are builtin apps lol
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Android is open source
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Not the Google shenanigans on top but Android is
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- But Open Camera is a popular FOSS app too
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :-  And there's many enhanced camera apps
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- yeah, I know, but the default one seems to minimalistic
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Like censoring / encrypting cameras
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- OpenCamera is not minimalistic for sure
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- I know there's freedcam but it seems a bit buggy to me
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- or at least not very well designed
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- There are lots
Blue (21550262) :- Hi, John, welcome to WFAF ~*
Blue (21550262) :- Hi, oio (#oio), welcome to WFAF ~*
Blue (21550262) :- Hi again, John, say 'what is wfaf' for more info ~*

Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- hmmm
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Some apps have complained like this messenger that I got for a friend
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- because it's rooted?
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- but when I told my friend that the messenger uses Google Play Services he was like yeah nvm let's not use it
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- No, it's not rooted, and in fact it supports Secure Boot
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- oooo
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Rooting or flashing to a non secure boot room sacrifices security
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Recently there was malware that could exploit rooted phones
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- mine is and it's annoying when it comes to banking apps
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- why?
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I stopped using banking apps myself
oio (24924918) :- root cloak ?
oio (24924918) :- isn't that working now ?
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- They warn you that someone could compromise it?
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- people are using them and I cannot leave them behind
oio (24924918) :- nah. . .  Bank apps won't open in rooted device 
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I see
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Leave who behind
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- the apps
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Can't you use them im browser
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- nope, not available
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- just on mobiles
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- annoying -_-
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Shit ass bank
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- ikr
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- So they don't have internet banking at all
Lumi (16008266) :- shark do do do~
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Or do they display a banner to use the app
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- and magisk had root cloak but it fell off
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- And does it work on PC
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- nope, can't use it on pc
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- The thing I most envy with rooted phones is different boot and unlock passwords
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- hmm what about people without smartphones, do they call to make transactions? Text?
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- use cash?
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- or at atm
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Cash is most private
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I suppose
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- that's why I think it won't disappear soon
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- But you still have to manage an account
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I see
oio (24924918) :- Magisk was amazing. . . 
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- yup
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- What's magisk
oio (24924918) :- but google bought him 
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- it's a new super su
oio (24924918) :- it's a rooting app\n
oio (24924918) :- that work differently
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I don't understand
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- you can't use an app to root, can you?
oio (24924918) :- you can 
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- That seems odd
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- you have to flash it
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- You still need to unlock the bootloader no?
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- yup
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I see
oio (24924918) :- that was 2 years before 
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- And it claims root privileges for itself
oio (24924918) :- Google gave the dude who made magisk\n
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- And offers a permission mechanism?
oio (24924918) :- yep 
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Sounds good
oio (24924918) :- but it no longer

Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I'll still have a backup
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Would be smart to put one at another relative but it's really more likely that I forget my encryption password at that point
Blue (21550262) :- Hi, Venus Gamorreans, welcome to WFAF ~*
Blue (21550262) :- Hi again, Venus Gamorreans, say 'what is wfaf' for more info ~*

Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- what should happen so you'll loose all your backups in the same time
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Haha, well at least I'm ahead of the curve on some things
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Luckily I can't be forced to give up my password but who knows, I'm malleable, so too many backups are also no good
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Like I said, one place burning down with my pc, phone, and primary physical backup + forgot cloud password
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- That would do it if it happened yesterday
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- so should be a bomb that would burn your place and confuse you hardly enough so you'll forget things?
Blue (21550262) :- Greetings Strawberry ^-^
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Excuse me
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I have no peace here
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- it's fine
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I wish my mom would queue up questions instead of disrupting me
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- ouch
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- maybe make a questioning on notes system
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- It's one reason I made sure to move out
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Spending several days with them has adverse effects on my mental health
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- including irratibility
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I'll be back at my place tomorrow
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- ooof
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- you're living alone?
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I just hate having my trains of thought  disrupted especially when I'm already multitasking and struggle with working memory despite needing the stimulation
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I live with roommates
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- aren't they as irritating?
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- During the summer, that can end up like living alone
Blue (21550262) :- Hi, its Blue ^-^
Blue (21550262) :- Hi, its Blue ^-^

Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- In fact, I'm having to bother them
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- doubt you can bother someone
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- maybe just with your cuteness
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- It's in the family I suppose -- turns out I'm not the quiet kid, I'm extraverted when it comes to info
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Haha, cuteness?
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- yesss
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Can't remember last time I had an IRL hug aside family
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- aside from*
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I don't radiate cuteness like you think
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I'm moreso invisible
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- sounds like me
Blue (21550262) :- Hi, Sacking Exeggcute, welcome to WFAF ~*
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- My roommates need me to bother them otherwise they'd not keep track of anything or keep the place clean 
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- My roommate kept questioning why I needed access to the router
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- then it's not bothering
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Haha, they always question why I want things to be a certain way
Blue (21550262) :- Hi, White Gungan, welcome to WFAF ~*
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- SO YOU CAN INSTALL OPENWRT TO ITTT
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- HAHAHAHA
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- My way, my order is the cocaine of my personality
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- They were thinking I had some sort of agenda
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Wanting to get into it
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Once we took the password off the hard to access router
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- And got into the admin portal
Blue (21550262) :- Hi, emily, welcome to WFAF ~*

Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I wanted to change the DNS at least but it's a telecom router so it didn't let us
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- ouch
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I remember when the roomie in charge of internet was gonna leave
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- and I said we should drop the telecom contract and find some independent provider
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- They were skeptical why would I want to do it when it works just fine
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I couldn't really explain to them why I want to avoid supporting telecom monopolies and proprietary routers
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- And I had enough responsibilities
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- So my other roomie just took the existing  contract
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- But it's kinda embarrassing when they study electronics and didn't ever try get into the router
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- ooof
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- well. .  for most people it works already is already an argument
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- why should they put more effort to get the same result
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Right
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I also floated hosting a document server for common affairs
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- But I guess my few dummy pieces of paper on the fridge work
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I succeeded making everyone give their contacts to send stuff like budget summary since I don't know if that Facebook group thing happened but I'm obv not in it
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- So yeah

Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- yeah
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I used to try productivity apps and habits.  Nothing stuck so I'm just floating thru life

Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- No, this conversation is more interesting 
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- aww :,)
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- She's just always suggesting food and I'm like can we set time aside for this
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Because I can't plan like that rn
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Right, diaries
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- she's just worried about you
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Yeah, she doesn't want me to lose weight lol
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Diaries are embarrassing to me because you're pretending someone is listening 
Blue (21550262) :- Hi, Mars (m), welcome to WFAF ~*
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Or reading
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- even if you're just describing your past actions?
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I can't get past the idea of writing down things like that
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- If it's only for me to read them
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Why? Is the diary paper a shadowy figure micromanaging my life?
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Why does it need to know all this? Cause I sure don't 
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- tbh yeah. .  maybe that's why I can't keep one either.  I feel like I'm wasting my time for something no one will ever use
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Glad I can characterize other people's feelings
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- By using my own experiences and empathy
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- If only interacting with people IRL wasn't so overwhelming that I can't process feelings anymore and I get lost
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- what if you won't look directly at them?
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- That helps in collecting my thoughts
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I remember one charismatic exception but -
