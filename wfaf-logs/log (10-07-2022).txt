Saturn (19364487) :- we gotta find out what this null gender is about
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- it's when you don't and can't have a gender
Saturn (19364487) :- how does that work?
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- do you know when someone puts a gender on them?
Saturn (19364487) :- when you enter Eme, it forces you to choose gender and you can have male, female or other
Saturn (19364487) :- so how are people ending up with null gender?
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- you just set none
Lumi (16008266) :- shark do do do~

Saturn (19364487) :- i just did
Saturn (19364487) :- however the popup comes later
Saturn (19364487) :- and you lose the null gender then

Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- hmmm
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- can't you skip it somehow?
Saturn (19364487) :- theres no obvious way to skip it, it iwll keep coming back
Saturn (19364487) :- just noticed another thing
Saturn (19364487) :- the great big red warning that says if you are under 18 then exit
Saturn (19364487) :- theres no exit button only in effect a continue button
Saturn (19364487) :- typical Callan
Saturn (19364487) :- you are in fact forced to say you are over 18 - its the only option
Saturn (19364487) :- priceless really
Ụ̴̼̉̕ñ̵̥́̚ì̶̗̪ (18560513) :- lol
