Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- so
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- Literally
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- It's not a bug, it's a feature 
Saturn (19364487) :- well its feature for us, is it a feature for smoothwing?
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- mhm, and maybe the cleanest part of this mess
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- Smoothwing is just a mediator with the admins, remember that 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- would not fancy their job
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- The fact he positively acknowledged RxE is a good start

Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I understand why he does it berry
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- problem is we shouldn't have that power
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- Yes, moral argument 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- if they want that power, they should ask for mods
Saturn (19364487) :- we maybe wont have that power if Eme do any more fixes :)
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- Yet, he does, and so far, it's been the only good one of its kind apart from Teri

Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- those alerts were annoying 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- was either that or stuffing wet toilet tissues into the speaker ports to make it shut up
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and I was told that wouldn't go down well with the medical staff

Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- to be fair, the staff just don't like me
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I suspect I'm something of an awkward patient
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- awkward to talk to? or awkward in circumstances of arrival ?
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- awkward because I know enough to see through the crap they try to tell you

Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- mm okay
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- though they've stopped treating that as a cardiac arrest now
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- I see

Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- well yes, the leads are nowhere near long enough for me to walk around my tiny room
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- or go to the bathroom
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- From your monitoring equipment
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- I see
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- before I used to take them off of the sticky pads
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and they used to see that as cardiac arrest
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- And they are too shoer staffed to assist you
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and come crashing in to save me
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- Mm. . 
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- Awkward. . 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- now I unplug the other end, so it shows no leads connected instead
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- so they know I'm not dead
Strawberry 🍓 (16521287) :- Okay
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- means I have to be careful walking around to avoid tripping over my leads
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- but means I don't scare the nurses out of their 17th coffee break

diamond heart (24960047) :- when I'm using a garlic press I tend to not do that but I should start
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- then if you actually want crushed garlic, salt the cloves and either crush with the flat of a big knife
diamond heart (24960047) :- no reason not to bash it before pressing it
