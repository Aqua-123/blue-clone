Strawberry 🍓 ⟨𝐑𝐱𝐄⟩ (16521287) :- Oh Q
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨𝐑𝐱𝐄⟩ (16521287) :- I think when you have low karma it highlights your karma in red in the extra user info
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨𝐑𝐱𝐄⟩ (16521287) :- And gives a tooltip about sending images
ㅤ (14267520) :- ooooo
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨𝐑𝐱𝐄⟩ (16521287) :- I think we could scrap that
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨𝐑𝐱𝐄⟩ (16521287) :- And instead move it to the upload pic menu
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨𝐑𝐱𝐄⟩ (16521287) :- since you already have CreateNote for that, just make it conditional on user karma
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨𝐑𝐱𝐄⟩ (16521287) :- Similar to old Emerald where the button was entirely hidden.​.​.​ otherwise the warning isn't really in a sensible place and it just sort of visually nags you about your karma
ㅤ (14267520) :- hm hmmm
Strawberry 🍓 ⟨𝐑𝐱𝐄⟩ (16521287) :- Since the last thing we need is more karma beggers, I suggest that's squeezed in before release
