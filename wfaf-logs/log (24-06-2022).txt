Saturn (19364487) :- i hope your Aunt is more sensible

<3 (24708860) :- she's definitely not
Saturn (19364487) :- nothing un normal about it
<3 (24708860) :- not about this stuff

<3 (24708860) :- he says it's ok
<3 (24708860) :- but yeah. . . 
Saturn (19364487) :- well if he says it is maybe it is

<3 (24708860) :- bc i was too gone
<3 (24708860) :- he does listen but he doesn't really know how to help
Saturn (19364487) :- mmm
<3 (24708860) :- he means well and i still really like him
<3 (24708860) :- but he's not very good with advice
Saturn (19364487) :- well consider an online or even offline group for your prefernce
Saturn (19364487) :- maybe one for your age group
<3 (24708860) :- i'm awful with groups
Saturn (19364487) :- that doesnt really matter
<3 (24708860) :- and if i knew how to talk to people off of the internet i would have done a long time ago
Saturn (19364487) :- you link up wiht the group
Saturn (19364487) :- you find someone to talk with there
<3 (24708860) :- idek how to do *that(

Saturn (19364487) :- well if you get grief about the choice you have made, at least consider looking into a group of people like you
Saturn (19364487) :- some of them will have had the same grief
<3 (24708860) :- it's not so much the choices as it is getting caught
<3 (24708860) :- and a community like that would probably just reinforce me wanting to do it. . .
