Coconut_Hugs (18133491) :- i see
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- the idea is, if the app detects you receiving a significant impact, or it detects your vitals through your smartwatch are wrong
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- it assumes you got injured
Coconut_Hugs (18133491) :- and it calls an ambulance ?

Saturn (19364487) :- Here's an interesting observation by more than a handful of my female patients: Their throats are sore for a few days just before their monthly periods.  It doesn't go on to a cold or other more severe symptoms.  Just a transient sore throat.  Then it goes away.
