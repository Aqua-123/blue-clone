diamond heart (24872539) :- really Jamie?
diamond heart (24872539) :- for what
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- mm, apparently
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- a friend of mine got his account terminated
Saturn (19364487) :- i think i heard of one too
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- because, apparently, he was a member of a server that occasionally discusses anime
diamond heart (24872539) :- 0 tolerance for weebs
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and I don't mean the questionable stuff, I mean like crunchyroll mainstream stuff
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- they booted the entire server and permanently banned everyone in it
diamond heart (24872539) :- lumi send did someone say weeaboo
Lumi (16008266) :- Image: i. \u200bimgur. \u200bcom/POJ5PMU. \u200bgif
Saturn (19364487) :- welll i wonder how that fits in with their codes of conduct and stuff
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- lol
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- as far as I know the mainstream stuff doesn't break any ToS
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- obviously the questionable stuff, sure
diamond heart (24872539) :- it's ok to sexualize the loli because she's actually a 237 year old vampire
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- yeah, I expect that kind of talk gets you a banhammer
Saturn (19364487) :- discord does seem to have had quite a drama about its ts and cs
Saturn (19364487) :- they added a bot to everyone to advertise changes
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- or the kind that looks like a 6 year old apart from the boobs, which you could land an aircraft on
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- that kind of stuff, fine, expect a banhammer
Saturn (19364487) :- :)
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I suppose it's their platform, they can do what they like
Saturn (19364487) :- one big thing seemed to be that public servers had to be much better behaved than private ones
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- just they seem to be a bit overzealous
Blue (21550262) :- Hi Jam Jamz ^-^
Saturn (19364487) :- maybe it was a copyright takedown thing
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- if it was, that company just lost a hundred or so followers
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- you don't DCMA your fans, that's a PR nightmare
Saturn (19364487) :- well it happens doesnt it :)
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- it's been known to
Saturn (19364487) :- fan sites gets grief for using copyright stuff
Saturn (19364487) :- i was just trying to read the discord ts and cs
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- if they were posting full episodes or something maybe
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I don't really know, I wasn't hit by it
Saturn (19364487) :- stuff about providing a nice experience, terribly vague stuff about age
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- just heard from a colleague
Saturn (19364487) :- clear stuff about copyright infringement
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- thing is though copyright infringement is not a clear thing
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- it's terribly grey
Saturn (19364487) :- mmm
Saturn (19364487) :- maybe there was a bust-up on the server and someone complained to discord
Saturn (19364487) :- there is complciated stuff about having clear grievance procedures
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- that wouldn't result in them nuking the server and everyone in it
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- it wasn't a small server
Saturn (19364487) :- mmm
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- or maybe it would
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- like I said, their platform, they can do what they like

Saturn (19364487) :- Each Discord server should have written rules for behavior to alleviate confusion or misunderstanding about what goes on for that particular community.  These rules, which supplement our Community Guidelines, are your tools to moderate efficiently and transparently.  As communities grow, moderators can add more mods to keep a server a fun and welcoming place to be. 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- translation: your moderators know more about what is acceptable on your server
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- so as long as you don't break the ToS, your call
Saturn (19364487) :- Through advanced tooling, machine learning, specialized Safety teams tackling specific abuse situations, and partnering with experts outside the company, our team works to remove high-harm abuse before it is viewed or experienced by others. 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- or, roughly the opposite of what actually happened
Saturn (19364487) :- maybe their AI closed the thing down
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I wouldn't expect a perma-ban for every user if that happened
Saturn (19364487) :- Depending on the severity, we may take a number of enforcement steps including but not limited to issuing warnings; removing content; temporarily or permanently disabling or removing the accounts and/or servers responsible; and potentially reporting them to law enforcement.  
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- meh
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- point being
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- discord isn't as reliable as it first appears
Saturn (19364487) :- yes
Saturn (19364487) :- 2086826 server members warned
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- warned
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- not banned into oblivion
Saturn (19364487) :- theres 13 categories that maybe give the best idea on what they are after
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- to be honest saturn
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- not my problem
Saturn (19364487) :- true
Saturn (19364487) :- well anyway they have published a report on what action they took
Lumi (16008266) :- shark do do do~
Saturn (19364487) :- and that seems to be the clearest bit of stuff about what bugs them
Saturn (19364487) :- and they do say unsurprisingly that very bad pics are their top priority
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- probably because it's their biggest problem
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- they, unlike here, probably DO have decent AI that handles that
Saturn (19364487) :- was just going to say that
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and they'll be using the photo ID database
Saturn (19364487) :- the official hashes on bad stuff
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- no, not hashes
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- image fingerprinting
Saturn (19364487) :- ah ok
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- hashes are easy to change
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- change one pixel, the hash has changed
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- image fingerprinting is more compute intensive, but is a lot harder to sneak past
Saturn (19364487) :- right
Saturn (19364487) :- an important difference
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- mm
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- also fingerprinting gives an is close to output
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- so cropped, adjusted, rotated etc
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- doesn't matter, it'll still be a 90-something% match to known bad images
Saturn (19364487) :- mmm
