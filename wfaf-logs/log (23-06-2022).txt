Ellie (16789499) :- hmm

Ellie (16789499) :- it would be unusual for that to be the case without some argument preceeding it
<3 (24708860) :- i kind of do that but i pretty much always end up cracking bc i actually really want help and to talk
<3 (24708860) :- well it doesn't have to involve you

Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- but that then solves your problem
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I have a couple in my basement
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- nah
Blue (21550262) :- Hi, Fuchsia Sullustan, welcome to WFAF ~*
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- it's not that high intensity
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- I'm not hosting my own website or anything
Blue (21550262) :- Penguins do be looking fine today :3
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- lol, that\'s not high intensity either really
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- unless you have a few thousand visitors a second
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- gone are the days when you needed an entire server or several servers to host a little website
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- just managing something in the background that won't be useful to interact with directly
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- only at a distance
Saturn Dathomirian (24804662) :- you could chuck in a ras pi and call it a day 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- have you tried to get one lately?
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- they're like unicorn farts
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- and it's come to the point where opening my password manager is a little too time consuming
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- memory or CPU issues?
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- or both
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- memory pretty sure
Blue (21550262) :- Hi again, Magenta Strawberry, say 'what is wfaf' for more info ~*
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- funny when htop. . .  tops out
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- anyways, i'm not gonna get anything else for a server component if i can replace this laptop with something and leave it for server stuff
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- which might be fun to poke around
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- SSD or HDD/
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- *?
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- unless my dad wants to adopt it for work
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- HDD
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- ok, thing I was going to suggest isn't a thing then :)
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- what's funny is
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- daemon warns you that it's slow on HDDs
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- but btrfs apparently obscured that since the start
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- only when i created a ext4 did it tell me
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- maybe it's only the EXT4 implementation that's the issue
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- BTRFS is CoW isn't it?
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- btrfs has modern doohickeys from what i read
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- depends what application of CoW you're referring to
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- from what I recall, does it not copy the thing you want to write into memory?
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- which is why you're supposed to have as much RAM as possible for CoW file systems?
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- hm
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- honestly, been a while since I did anything involving file systems that wasn't EXT4
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- mine came bundled
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- btrfs
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- on a laptop?
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- well no
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- with the distro
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- which distro are you using?
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- dora
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- that's an interesting choice
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- not fedora, BTRFS
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- i see
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- wishing i'd started with debian
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- that way your distro isn't always in the footnotes
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I kind of get it, BTRFS is safer if you do something silly with your filesystem like hot-unplug a disk that isn't supposed to be hot-pluggable
Blue (21550262) :- Hello, Magenta Strawberry, try asking 'what is wfaf' for more info ~*
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- depends what you want to do with it I guess
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- hmm
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- daily drive haha
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- but it gets more specific yes
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- luckily I've only had issues with one of the three games I play
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- to be fair
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- these days, most games have no excuse not to support Linux
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- Mhm
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- if it's based on Unity or Unreal you can just have it build a linux version
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- The one in question is sort of a patchwork
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- But it seems it compiled for Linux just fine, on their end I mean
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- One annoyance is manually adding downloaded executables to the very convenient gnome menu
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- meh, I can type it faster in the terminal :)
Blue (21550262) :- Hi, Magenta Strawberry, welcome to WFAF ~*
Blue (21550262) :- Saw that one coming
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- lol
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- it's true!
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- Saw what coming-
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- I missed something it seems
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I assume you missed I can type it faster in the terminal?
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- Ah
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- Not faster than the windows key and the name of the executable
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- If you're using it frequently
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- Or, Super key, yk
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I should see if I can get a tux key for my keyboard, to be fair
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- Cute
Blue (21550262) :- Hi again, Magenta Strawberry, say 'what is wfaf' for more info ~*
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- the Windows key is a little redundant unless I'm in my Win10 VM
Blue (21550262) :- Yeah jamie said they >What do you daily drive, jamie?
Blue (21550262) :- oops
Blue (21550262) :- uhh
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- It would be nice for RxE development if I could have my IDE with project loaded and the browser open
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- At the same time
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- which IDE are you using?
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- Currently I'm resorting to gedit but no autolinting which means I get CI fails in my email
Blue (21550262) :- Hi, \u200e (#voidexception), welcome to WFAF ~*
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- VSCodium
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- Hey Q
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- yeah, VS code was my suggestion
‎ (24039236) :- Hi hi
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- there's an extension that lets you see live code changes on web projects
‎ (24039236) :- We use webpack live server
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- to be fair I don't know if that'd work for TM scripts
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- I also avoid running the webpack server in VSCode's integrated terminal
‎ (24039236) :- For me vscode with live server running tends to have eugh memory spikes 
‎ (24039236) :- which becomes annoying
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- If VSCode crashes, Webpack server does too, and that takes a minute to initialize
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- to be fair I'm not a huge fan of VS code, but I did come from the full VS
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- not comparable
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- I'm not a fan of VS meanwhile
‎ (24039236) :- due to this i was looking into switching to nvim butttt linting is annoying there
Blue (21550262) :- Hi, Hottguy, welcome to WFAF ~*
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- Oh, reminds me, vim even has highlighting for TSX
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- to be fair berry, for what you seem to be doing, VS is way overkill :)
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- I used VS in graphics class for C++
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- Fun to sit there for CMake Cache to refresh (:
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- And the ugly menus
‎ (24039236) :- vim can do lots it just demands time for configuring and making things work in the first place 
Magenta Strawberry (24809463) :- Be right back I'll get on my account
‎ (24039236) :- which can drastically reduce the hair count on your head 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- lol
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- there's something to be said for a nice simple text editor
‎ (24039236) :- indeed
‎ (24039236) :- vscode does that 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- it's kinda laggy though
‎ (24039236) :- exactly 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- depending on what you're doing
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I'm doing a lot of embedded and x86-ish C at the moment
‎ (24039236) :- mhm
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- VS isn't an option because Linux
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and VS code is clunky
‎ (24039236) :- mhm
‎ (24039236) :- just a polished version of vscode would be go a long way really 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- mm, also one that doesn't complain about #includes when yes, the header file IS where I told you it was
‎ (24039236) :- lol
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- it doesn't like one of the embedded compilers for some reason
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- #include <xc. h>
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- xc. h does not exist
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- no, it REALLY does
‎ (24039236) :- lol
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- compiles
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- see, told you it exists
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- xc. h does not exist
‎ (24039236) :- lmfao
‎ (24039236) :- ive had that in python, recently switch case was introduced and i so wanted to use it, vscode.  just.  wont.  let me. 
‎ (24039236) :- invalid syntax :)
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- not enough or too many white space indents
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- hate python
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I understand why it exists
‎ (24039236) :- mhm
Blue (21550262) :- Greetings Strawberry ^-^
‎ (24039236) :- wb
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I give up
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- but when your code listing takes up several LANDSCAPE pages because indents
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I'm logged in on my phone
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- time for a language that uses {}
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- wb berry
‎ (24039236) :- well yes i can agree on that 
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- All this time the program I needed to get my password DB didn't open
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Anyway
‎ (24039236) :- Oof
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- What are you two talking about
‎ (24039236) :- python = bad 
‎ (24039236) :- bacause 
‎ (24039236) :- white spaces
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- indents yeah
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- a lack of polished and light IDE on Linux
‎ (24039236) :- ^ 
‎ (24039236) :- and that
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Just decompose functions and use abstractions
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Python has decorators for a reason
‎ (24039236) :- the only reason blue is still in python 
‎ (24039236) :- :)
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I'll stick to C# for little applet-type things thanks
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I want a Pylint 10/10 sticker
‎ (24039236) :- oh no pylint can be super annoying as well, unnecessarily at times
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Reminds me of a friend who'd always recommend me Blazor
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- that's a web framework isn't it?
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Problem is I can't put up with Css
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- C#
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Correct
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Aqua, I still suck up to pylint
‎ (24039236) :- i mean after using eslint. . .  boy 
‎ (24039236) :- its so much worse
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- :))
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Missing module docstring~
‎ (24039236) :- ugh

‎ (24039236) :- good
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- sorry, Jamie was busy convincing VS code that XC. h did exist
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- Jamie lost
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- kills daemon my patience is finite
‎ (24039236) :- lmaoo

Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- joking, probably
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- What's XC. h
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- XC. h is the compiler include file for Microchip XC8/16/32 compiler
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- C header file in your projext?
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Hmm
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Nitty gritty
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- XC is the compiler series for targeting Microchip ICs
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- yeah, bare metal
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- you missed this, VS code is adamant that XC. h doesn't exist
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- but it does, and it compiles
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Mhm
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- so it's just VSC being it's usual vaguely broken self
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I only have the golden advice
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- stop using VS code?
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- no
‎ (24039236) :- use notepad
Lumi (16008266) :- shark do do do~
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Turn off, and on again. 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- lol

Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- should never try to grow out of youthful things lol
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Haha, you're feeling disillusioned of adulthood I take it?
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- it's not as fun as it looks when you're 10 
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I did never want to grow up
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- But I see maturity as a goal now
‎ (24039236) :- At the age of 17, when looking up to older age, the peacefulness seems attractive rather than fun
‎ (24039236) :- 
‎ (24039236) :- 
‎ (24039236) :- 
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Come to think of it, the situation of N should tell me that I'm doing just fine

princesshugs_give0🖕 (18133491) :- yea :/
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- You don't like someone who spreads themselves thin, because it doesn't give you the credit you think you deserve
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- If I'm trying to talk to all my friends at once, it's because I can't choose, I don't know what I want
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- And you don't respect that
princesshugs_give0🖕 (18133491) :- no

Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Okay
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I'm just using a personality framework to assume things about you haha
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- It mostly works I guess :))
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- What do you feel like doing now?
princesshugs_give0🖕 (18133491) :- i only waste time on things i think are important and if i figure out that i wasted time for no reason then i get mad at myself and i find wys to make it better

princesshugs_give0🖕 (18133491) :- umm like in general
Blue (21550262) :- Hi, Orange Poppadom, welcome to WFAF ~*
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Does online count?
princesshugs_give0🖕 (18133491) :- if you think so then yea
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I'm critical towards myself that I only get close to people online
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I've done a lot of things online so that would be a yes
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- But I haven't held hands IRL so there's an imbalance there
princesshugs_give0🖕 (18133491) :- okay i see
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I don't think you would count it so I won't either
princesshugs_give0🖕 (18133491) :- hmm
princesshugs_give0🖕 (18133491) :- i see
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- And I want to keep that pressure on me instead of feeling complacement
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Complacent* 
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Which means like feeling like you're fine, you're done, you achieved something, you can rest
princesshugs_give0🖕 (18133491) :- oh okay i see
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I don't think I should talk about details here though
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Like intimacy
princesshugs_give0🖕 (18133491) :- why not?
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Well we try to keep this family friendly
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- And someone's probably recording everything everyone says anyway
princesshugs_give0🖕 (18133491) :- oh 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- bit of a tinfoil hat moment there berry lol
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Plus there are people lurking like Jamie
princesshugs_give0🖕 (18133491) :- im curious
princesshugs_give0🖕 (18133491) :- lmaoo
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- true
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- lurks under the bar
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Jamie, for the record (pun intended), GCs were logged by at least two people, and Nurse tracks where people were last seen across all of Emerald
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Not to mention all the rumours of Z keeping tabs
Blue (21550262) :- Hi, Julien french, welcome to WFAF ~*
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- nurse I knew about
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Be right back
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- kinda hardly worth it though
Blue (21550262) :- Hi, princesshugs_give0, welcome to WFAF ~*
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- And I don't even know what happens to DMs with people you unfriend
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- nobody does lol
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- If I'm supposed to assume that they persist and are queryable
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- it'll all get stuffed into a big some-sql database somewhere
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Then I should have probably left long ago
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and maybe pruned once in a while
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Maybe
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Speaking of which
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I don't think you ever answered whether you'd like to join one of my nerdy apps
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Especially since now the situation would have you want immediate notice from me
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- immediate is relative berry, at this point I'd rather stick to the two-and-a-half I have
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- The apps you're used to, you mean?
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- mm, I'm on discord, here and opal
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Fair enough
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Wiping my Discord is a long haul it seems
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Jamie
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Do you think the 1000 DM message history limit corresponds to actual database space?
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- no
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- more likely the UI lags like hell when you get that many messages 
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I mean, would past messages get thrown away or is that needless overhead
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Oh fair
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I meant the Load More
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- which would make sense, a while ago we had to periodically wipe greeter message history
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- dances in memleak
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- DOM sure is efficient
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- DOM is fine, the questionable site coding on the other hand
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Well, bless modern framework
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Mm fair
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Some of that RxE fixes
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Oh funny story
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Remember how we talked about the Debian server I was going to deploy on?
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I asked for it to be setup a month ago as well as some database records for the project from boss
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- didn't like the idea?
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Both of those are stagnating so I may or may not be making a loss for lack of work
Blue (21550262) :- Hi, Eating Panda, welcome to WFAF ~*
Blue (21550262) :- Hi again, Eating Panda, say 'what is wfaf' for more info ~*
Eating Panda (24810712) :- hey you there?
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Our server guy is a graduate with family whose main client is his alma mater
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- I figured he'd be competent but well. . 
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Turns out he's just learning how to set up Linux VMs
Blue (21550262) :- Hello, Eating Panda, try asking 'what is wfaf' for more info ~*
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- oh dear
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- The previous ones have all been windows ones
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Wasn't exactly a Linux user when I was hired
princesshugs_give0🖕 (18133491) :- imma eat it ahhhhhh
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Suppose I should have told him earlier so he'd have had time
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Hugs, what are you going to eat?
Strawberry 🍓 • 𝐑𝐱𝐄. (16521287) :- Eating Panda?
princesshugs_give0🖕 (18133491) :- ice cream
