Harenoir (11427049) :- you can only do as much good as far as the concept of good goes around

Harenoir (11427049) :- the point being
Harenoir (11427049) :- if that's the case
Harenoir (11427049) :- to whom do you care the most: the people or their concept of good?
Harenoir (11427049) :- people can be cool and nice and whatnot

Harenoir (11427049) :- never reaching an agreement
Harenoir (11427049) :- easy fix: let\'s put aside our differences and work together!
Harenoir (11427049) :- haha no
Harenoir (11427049) :- that barely happens in practice
Harenoir (11427049) :- and that doesn't mean everyone is wrong, or everyone is right (in a way)
Harenoir (11427049) :- that's when you, for youself, have to stand aside
Harenoir (11427049) :- and think for yourself
Harenoir (11427049) :- yes, it's all about perspective, but which perspective?
Harenoir (11427049) :- the one that i like the most?
Harenoir (11427049) :- the one that i think it\'s the right one?
Harenoir (11427049) :- i could say it\'s all meaningless and meh, who cares
Harenoir (11427049) :- just to avoid thinking about it too much
Harenoir (11427049) :- or because i genuinely don't care about this kind of stuff
Harenoir (11427049) :- but hear me out
Harenoir (11427049) :- that's where we draw the line
Harenoir (11427049) :- between thinking for yourself, and having this thinking affecting the people that are around us
Harenoir (11427049) :- sure, you can have your own opinion about delicate stuff
Harenoir (11427049) :- but, are you going to let it affect other people?
Harenoir (11427049) :- like
Harenoir (11427049) :- if they think different than you, you'll still be around them or cut then down entirely?
Harenoir (11427049) :- it\'s easy to say yeah i respect your opinion and whatever
Harenoir (11427049) :- but that doesn't mean you'll get to the extreme of forcing a relationship with them just because you don't want to end up in bad terms
Harenoir (11427049) :- that's where you have to be clear with yourself
Harenoir (11427049) :- despite all this, if you still have people around, good for you
Harenoir (11427049) :- if not, good for you too
Harenoir (11427049) :- that's life
Harenoir (11427049) :- where people are complex, dumb and think they're right and doing good stuff for themselves and others
Harenoir (11427049) :- while i'm here, just overthinking as usual
Harenoir (11427049) :- god, i guess i do really have too much free time in my hands
