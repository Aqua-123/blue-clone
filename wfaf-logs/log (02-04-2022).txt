Saturn (19364487) :- not saying much

Saturn (19364487) :- mecha is a bot
Harenoir (11427049) :- and here thinking he actually was a person.​.​.​ of sorts

Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Inventing Poppadom! Welcome to the place where your dreams used to come true!~

‏ (14267520) :- i thought  yall kneww
Harenoir (11427049) :- well, i genuinely didn't
‏ (14267520) :- cause mecha and omni go mad in sync when the exploit is used
Harenoir (11427049) :- i mean yeah but
Harenoir (11427049) :- i thought omni was.​.​.​ i dunno
Harenoir (11427049) :- just a casuality
‏ (14267520) :- fair 
‏ (14267520) :- blue get details of 20909232

Saturn (19364487) :- the guy used to talk to us
Harenoir (11427049) :- or someone who left their acc logged a lot
Saturn (19364487) :- he talked to quite a few people
‏ (14267520) :- i mean you can view the profile 
‏ (14267520) :- its an rxe pic 
‏ (14267520) :- only some people have access to that version 
Harenoir (11427049) :- ah yes.​.​.​
Harenoir (11427049) :- right
Harenoir (11427049) :- still, i guess i'm slow at this stuff
Saturn (19364487) :- he did a maths bot first
Harenoir (11427049) :- the famous math bot
‏ (14267520) :- yeah
Saturn (19364487) :- but apparently maths bots are hazardous
Harenoir (11427049) :- are they?
Saturn (19364487) :- someone could feed in rogue input
Saturn (19364487) :- and get it executed
Saturn (19364487) :- unless you code carefully
Harenoir (11427049) :- mhmm
‏ (14267520) :- im sure lupus coded it fairly decently 
Harenoir (11427049) :- lots of int, i'm guessing
‏ (14267520) :- 45 years of experience is not less
‏ (14267520) :- 25 but whatever
Harenoir (11427049) :- 4.​.​.​5?
‏ (14267520) :- he retired like a month ago
Harenoir (11427049) :- huh
‏ (14267520) :- and he is in his 40s
Harenoir (11427049) :- that's.​.​.​ quite the lot
‏ (14267520) :- which is why i changed to 25
Harenoir (11427049) :- oh
‏ (14267520) :- idk why i said 45-
Saturn (19364487) :- he did seem good at coding
Saturn (19364487) :- but he said he was wary of it being hacked
Saturn (19364487) :- bresh tried to once
‏ (14267520) :- ah yes he did 
‏ (14267520) :- he left a rce exploit in mecha as well
‏ (14267520) :- in the seen lookup
Saturn (19364487) :- oh
Harenoir (11427049) :- what for?
‏ (14267520) :- the ' in kims name wasnt escaped so if you made a proper query you could execute any arbitrary code
‏ (14267520) :- and cause he formats it in a bash script
‏ (14267520) :- it was much mor
‏ (14267520) :- e
‏ (14267520) :- dangerous 
Harenoir (11427049) :- right.​.​.​
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Cheering Tomato! Welcome to the place where your dreams used to come true!~
‏ (14267520) :- im sure blue maybe has such exploits 
‏ (14267520) :- but i tried to follow the rules 
Saturn (19364487) :- so he needs to fix that vulnerability
‏ (14267520) :- he already did 
‏ (14267520) :- he told me after he fixed 
‏ (14267520) :- he found it himself apparently 
Saturn (19364487) :- ah ok
‏ (14267520) :- and fixed it
Harenoir (11427049) :- well, that's good
Saturn (19364487) :- wise of him to fix it first and only chat about it after :)
Harenoir (11427049) :- tricky
Saturn (19364487) :- especially since he seems to leave mecha fending on her own for days on end
‏ (14267520) :- mhm
‏ (14267520) :- yeah which is why he moved mecha to an aws instance 
‏ (14267520) :- so that even if it is exploited 
‏ (14267520) :- it doesnt affect anything 
‏ (14267520) :- since its an empty vm
Saturn (19364487) :- so they would hack into a nothing
‏ (14267520) :- correct
‏ (14267520) :- although im not sure if its still on the aws thingy 
‏ (14267520) :- cause the other day he said he had to restart mecha cause he had to fix his ups
‏ (14267520) :- which.​.​.​
‏ (14267520) :- well
‏ (14267520) :- points to 
‏ (14267520) :- it runs on his machine 
Harenoir (11427049) :- mecha who's here
🤖 Mecha Nurse 💉 (20909261) :- I can see 'Harenoir', '\u200f' (#___), 'Lumi', 'Saturn'.​ Also 1 person is idle, and there may be lurkers.​
Saturn (19364487) :- right
Harenoir (11427049) :- mecha who's idle
🤖 Mecha Nurse 💉 (20909261) :- I think 'Blue' is idle.​
Saturn (19364487) :- noooo
Saturn (19364487) :- blue hardworking
Saturn (19364487) :- hi blue
Blue (21550262) :- Hellosss :D
Saturn (19364487) :- seeee
Saturn (19364487) :- im curious about mecha's proverbs
Saturn (19364487) :- they dont seem to follow a pattern
Harenoir (11427049) :- most are depressing
Saturn (19364487) :- yes that too
Saturn (19364487) :- i wonder what triggers them off
‏ (14267520) :- earlier they were haikus 
‏ (14267520) :- ah 
‏ (14267520) :- the trigger 
‏ (14267520) :- she checks for an AlmostLonely function
‏ (14267520) :- which checks how many people are there in wfaf
Saturn (19364487) :- ahhhhhh
‏ (14267520) :- apart from the greeters
Saturn (19364487) :- is that it
‏ (14267520) :- soo if its 1 or 2 
Saturn (19364487) :- interesting
‏ (14267520) :- then its triggered 
‏ (14267520) :- im not sure if its triggered at 2 
‏ (14267520) :- but it is at 1 
‏ (14267520) :- he mainly added it when wfaf was completely dead 
Saturn (19364487) :- that is quite ingenious really
Harenoir (11427049) :- clearly, because mecha always interrupts my monologue
‏ (14267520) :- and there were just 3 greeters running 24/7
Saturn (19364487) :- i kept wondering if he was there
Saturn (19364487) :- you and your monologues teri :)
Harenoir (11427049) :- yea.​ .​ .​
‏ (14267520) :- yeahhh ive read mechas code a couple of times just out of curiosity 
Saturn (19364487) :- ah ok so he may have been absent for months now
Saturn (19364487) :- just mecha running on an ingenious auto system
‏ (14267520) :- not really he was here couple weeks ago 
Harenoir (11427049) :- i've seen him recently tho
‏ (14267520) :- yeah
Saturn (19364487) :- oh nice
Saturn (19364487) :- shame i missed that
Harenoir (11427049) :- he even helped me with some.​.​.​ stuff i had
‏ (14267520) :- and im sure he takes a look at the terminal a couple of times, regularly 
Saturn (19364487) :- oh helpful
Saturn (19364487) :- its also interesting that callan is apparently chatting a bit
Harenoir (11427049) :- callan is also around, yeah
Saturn (19364487) :- does callan go  to GC anymore?
Harenoir (11427049) :- mecha seen 2 in *

Harenoir (11427049) :- ^ there
Saturn (19364487) :- after his famous visits way back
Saturn (19364487) :- well im surprised
Harenoir (11427049) :- clearly around, but still doesn't care
Saturn (19364487) :- i wonder if he chatted
Saturn (19364487) :- i guess he might have popped in and not found anyone
Harenoir (11427049) :- probably
Lumi (16008266) :- Your friendly neighbourhood Saturn is here! *~~.​
Saturn (19364487) :- i think i go with the theory that he sold eme because it became such a pain
Saturn (19364487) :- and he is still responsible to fix it if it falls to bits
Saturn (19364487) :- for the new owners
Harenoir (11427049) :- right
Harenoir (11427049) :- but still responsible
Harenoir (11427049) :- up to some point
‏ (14267520) :- checked logs, he said nothing, joined and left like 13 times
Saturn (19364487) :- the deal is that he doesnt have to make it work properly
Saturn (19364487) :- but if someone exploits it
Saturn (19364487) :- then he is probably supposed to sort that
Harenoir (11427049) :- i-
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Lemons 🍋 ! Welcome to the place where your dreams used to come true!~
Harenoir (11427049) :- hm right
Saturn (19364487) :- i guess if someone messes up karma too badly then he is supposed to disable karma
Saturn (19364487) :- but he really doesnt want to
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Cnyster! Welcome to the place where your dreams used to come true!~
Harenoir (11427049) :- i mean, he was always in favour of karma
Harenoir (11427049) :- because of bots and suchlike
Saturn (19364487) :- in favour to put it mildly
‏ (14267520) :- i like exploiting stuff sooo might favour karma.​.​.​.​ but its tooo annoying
Saturn (19364487) :- he thought that was going to be his super power
Harenoir (11427049) :- and i mean, he didn't disabled it before
Harenoir (11427049) :- doubtful he will nowdays
Saturn (19364487) :- when it gets to the point of it disconnecting everyone, its a bit of a problem
‏ (14267520) :- all he has to do is block the karma request really 
Saturn (19364487) :- that figures
Harenoir (11427049) :- yet here we are
Saturn (19364487) :- if people exploit it so far that eme dies for hours
‏ (14267520) :- UnU
Saturn (19364487) :- then i guess he is obliged to sort that
Harenoir (11427049) :- owo
‏ (14267520) :- *hides*
Blue (21550262) :- 0.​\u200b0
Saturn (19364487) :- its a bit like what happened with the main search
Saturn (19364487) :- that he then zapped
Saturn (19364487) :- you hid :)
Harenoir (11427049) :- lmao
Saturn (19364487) :- too much karma
Harenoir (11427049) :- i mean, technically i should hide too
‏ (14267520) :- :eyes:
‏ (14267520) :- alright peoples 
Saturn (19364487) :- at least he didnt turn eme all white and unusable :)
‏ (14267520) :- question of the century 
‏ (14267520) :- camel-case naming or snake-case
Harenoir (11427049) :- comic sans
‏ (14267520) :- i-
‏ (14267520) :- lemme clear it up 
Saturn (19364487) :- infamous comic sans
‏ (14267520) :- camel-case = MyNameIsAqua
‏ (14267520) :- and 
Saturn (19364487) :- san serriffe
‏ (14267520) :- snake-case = my_name_is_aqua
‏ (14267520) :- (programming related)
Harenoir (11427049) :- camel case

‏ (14267520) :- idkk i cant pick 
‏ (14267520) :- i like camelcase 
‏ (14267520) :- but
Saturn (19364487) :- camel seems quite nice
Saturn (19364487) :- those caps are really useful
‏ (14267520) :- i generally end up using snake case 
‏ (14267520) :- as apparent in lumis code
Saturn (19364487) :- i guess snake is easier to do
Saturn (19364487) :- fewwer mistakes
Harenoir (11427049) :- i also use snake case often
‏ (14267520) :- yeah its just 
Harenoir (11427049) :- but i heard camel case is.​.​ neater i think
‏ (14267520) :- you have in mind this variable stores user id and you name it user_id
Saturn (19364487) :- its fewer characters so maybe more ecoonomical on something
Harenoir (11427049) :- no actually
Harenoir (11427049) :- snake should be used for variable names
‏ (14267520) :- yeah RxE is all CamelCase and i sometimes struggle with it 
Harenoir (11427049) :- and camel for function names
Harenoir (11427049) :- mhmm
‏ (14267520) :- and camel for functio-
‏ (14267520) :- yeah
Saturn (19364487) :- interesting
Saturn (19364487) :- i wonder if the yellow bots have gone
‏ (14267520) :- ooo

‏ (14267520) :- yeah 
Harenoir (11427049) :- and considering my own testing results.​.​.​
‏ (14267520) :- i mean if it stops i can keep trying to push it further 
‏ (14267520) :- and fine tuning 
‏ (14267520) :- or maybe trying something completely new 
Harenoir (11427049) :- if you can workaround those 503s
‏ (14267520) :- well with the same concept 
‏ (14267520) :- different approach 
‏ (14267520) :- like i changed from threading to async 
Harenoir (11427049) :- so.​.​.​ back to threading?
Harenoir (11427049) :- or some other new thing?
‏ (14267520) :- (the async code was almost copy paste from the internet)
Harenoir (11427049) :- o.​o
Blue (21550262) :- 0.​\u200b0
‏ (14267520) :- yeah maybe new cause threading is tooo inefficient

Harenoir (11427049) :- mhmm
Lumi (16008266) :- Your friendly neighbourhood Saturn is here! *~~.​
Harenoir (11427049) :- and something that doesn't blow up the server either

‏ (14267520) :- threading seemed to do that
Harenoir (11427049) :- uh
Harenoir (11427049) :- like when i threaded myself
‏ (14267520) :- yes
Harenoir (11427049) :- i guess i still was sleepy
Harenoir (11427049) :- dunno what i was thinking
‏ (14267520) :- yakno you could.​.​.​ COULD.​.​.​.​ make kb more efficient with async 
‏ (14267520) :- would i 
‏ (14267520) :- nah
‏ (14267520) :- i have too much stuff already configured with threading
Harenoir (11427049) :- threading already does the work tho
‏ (14267520) :- more efficient here is just a few miliseconds at best 
‏ (14267520) :- but easier for the server
Harenoir (11427049) :- i mean
‏ (14267520) :- somehow-
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Orchid Tangerine! Welcome to the place where your dreams used to come true!~

‏ (14267520) :- we got some nice logic going on now 
‏ (14267520) :- lets seeee

Harenoir (11427049) :- god.​.​.​ i'm wondering if i want to hear that
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- Okay new tab 
Saturn (19364487) :- ban number?
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- It's.​.​.​ 3 months now.​.​
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- id=2343149
Saturn (19364487) :- thats the same
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- Idk\n
Saturn (19364487) :- i htink you need to open in a new tab
Saturn (19364487) :- refrehsing might not do it
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- New tab it is\n
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- BANNED\n\nDURATION\nover 1 year\n\nREASON\nOur users have given you a lot of negative karma points.​ You were possibly skipping people too much or harassing users.​ You have been banned for one day.​
Saturn (19364487) :- ban number?
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- BANNED\n\nDURATION\n3 months\n
Saturn (19364487) :- ban number?
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- I said it already.​.​.​
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- U want me to reload?
Saturn (19364487) :- 234 .​.​.​
Saturn (19364487) :- it shows in the address bar
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- 3149
Saturn (19364487) :- ok well when i do it, the ban number reduces
Saturn (19364487) :- by a few
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- One month now\n
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- And still same number\n
Saturn (19364487) :- well this is new
Saturn (19364487) :- the ban number is staying the same
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- 20 hours now\n
Saturn (19364487) :- however maybe the same thing works
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- Still same number\n
Saturn (19364487) :- if you keep reloading
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- No it's all new tabs\n
Saturn (19364487) :- then you may clear it out
Saturn (19364487) :- or new tabbing
Saturn (19364487) :- cos reloading tends to just go back to the eams thing
Saturn (19364487) :- after a few tabs eme locks you out
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- .​.​.​.​
Saturn (19364487) :- so then you have to wait a mo
Saturn (19364487) :- but then you can carry on
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- Huh? I had opened 23 tabs yesterday
Saturn (19364487) :- its the speed that matters
‏ (14267520) :- welp i just got myself banned
‏ (14267520) :- -_-
Saturn (19364487) :- too many operatons quickly and eme gets upset
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- Wow.​
Saturn (19364487) :- anywya as background
Saturn (19364487) :- eme used to have bans from 1 hour 1 day 1 month up to 1 year
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- Also, 20 hrs and still the same number in a new tab\n
Saturn (19364487) :- now stricitly speaking it only has 1 hour and 1 day bans
Saturn (19364487) :- so when you see a ban of a different period it is really several bans on top of each other
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- Oh.​
Saturn (19364487) :- and by doing new tabs reepeatedly once the one hour or one day has ended
Saturn (19364487) :- you can clear these bans off
Saturn (19364487) :- and eventually you are free
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- Oh.​
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- So i should just keep opening tabs now?
Saturn (19364487) :- as i said i had a -60,000 karma ban the other day
Saturn (19364487) :- and it took a lot of patience
Saturn (19364487) :- but after all the new tabs it is now gone
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- Interesting as hell.​
‏ (14267520) :- Awh man 24h ban 
‏ (14267520) :- this is gonna break so many things in blue
‏ (14267520) :- argh
Saturn (19364487) :- well you may or may not have the patience
‏ (14267520) :- blue get id of sat
Lumi (16008266) :- Our favorite Blue greeter is here!
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- I can be patient.​
Harenoir (11427049) :- ah

Blue (21550262) :- Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩ (#strawberry) was last seen today 1 hours ago in WFAF but was more recently seen today 1 hours ago  in pizza squad 🍕
‏ (14267520) :- ok that didnt 
Harenoir (11427049) :- i think i know where is that going
Saturn (19364487) :- but its nice to have the option :)
‏ (14267520) :- ugh
Saturn (19364487) :- and one day you might really need it
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- Yea like today .​
🤖 Mecha Nurse 💉 (20909261) :- I last saw 'Strawberry 🍓 ⟨RxE⟩' (#strawberry) 16521287 in WFAF 1 hour, 37 minutes ago.​
Harenoir (11427049) :- happened to me when i refreshed the ban tab, and the ban duration kept changing
Harenoir (11427049) :- but ofc i never got too much into it
Saturn (19364487) :- yes the ban duratoin tends to change
Saturn (19364487) :- with my recent one it went up in days, from one to .​.​.​
Harenoir (11427049) :- i'm guessing you found a way to work around that
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- Saturn certainly is very observant.​
Saturn (19364487) :- landed up at 12 dyas eventually
Saturn (19364487) :- at which point iit vanished :)
Harenoir (11427049) :- aha
Harenoir (11427049) :- so you managed to change the duration
Harenoir (11427049) :- and keep it there
Saturn (19364487) :- with mine the ban number always reduces with each new tab
Harenoir (11427049) :- thus fooling the system
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- Oof i went to emerald cat instead of emerald chat.​
Harenoir (11427049) :- interesting.​.​.​
Saturn (19364487) :- but maybe this depends on how quickly you were banned
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- Yea ig\n
Harenoir (11427049) :- or how much you manipulate your tabs
Saturn (19364487) :- i dont think its so much abuot changing the duration as about clearing one by one
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- So from one year, i have 20 hours ban now.​
Saturn (19364487) :- a great number of bans that are all on top of each other
Harenoir (11427049) :- i managed to change the duration.​.​.​ but i never could be sure if it'd stay there
‏ (14267520) :- (ill go sit in the cawnah for next 24 hours, cyah)
Saturn (19364487) :- if you have one ban you need to refresh when it is finished to clear it
Harenoir (11427049) :- mhm
Saturn (19364487) :- similarly if you have one hundred bans all of which were one day and expired
Harenoir (11427049) :- yes true
Saturn (19364487) :- you need to refresh one hundred times to clear them all
Harenoir (11427049) :- hm
Harenoir (11427049) :- you would just refresh all those tabs, right?
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- Aq u could.​.​.​ Use a VPN can't u?
Harenoir (11427049) :- yeah thought so
Saturn (19364487) :- yes
Saturn (19364487) :- and when i have done it the reducing ban number confirms the progress
Saturn (19364487) :- but apparently not for gashing sphere
Harenoir (11427049) :- very interesting
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- 10 tabs 10 time refresh 
Harenoir (11427049) :- yeah, neither for me tbh
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, AcetheWoan (Bi F) ! Welcome to the place where your dreams used to come true!~
Harenoir (11427049) :- i've tried it, but it's very tricky
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- For ip bans only one way is to change ip right?
Harenoir (11427049) :- yes
Saturn (19364487) :- you still not understand :)
Harenoir (11427049) :- and for id ban, change account
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- Hmm oki.​
Saturn (19364487) :- all bans are both ip and id
Saturn (19364487) :- you always have to change ip first
Harenoir (11427049) :- wait right
Saturn (19364487) :- then you have to deal with id
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- Then reduce id manually
Harenoir (11427049) :- right, i need to change that
Harenoir (11427049) :- ahem
Saturn (19364487) :- once you have changed ip you can open another eme account
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- I got it!
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- And yea\n
Saturn (19364487) :- until you change ip your eme is totally dead everywhere
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- New account.​
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- Tho it's useless now.​
Saturn (19364487) :- one little tip - if you make sure to friend your account from another account
Saturn (19364487) :- then if it gets banned you can see how much karma
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- Yea right.​
Saturn (19364487) :- if its only -30 karma you can get back in easil after the one day
Saturn (19364487) :- if it is -60,000 karma, after the one day, you have a long job ahead refreshing it
Harenoir (11427049) :- wait.​.​.​
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- It would be a pain.​
Saturn (19364487) :- it was a pain :)
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- ;-;
Harenoir (11427049) :- oh.​.​.​
Saturn (19364487) :- its novel to have an account wiht -60,000 karma now :)
Harenoir (11427049) :- and you still managed to get it working.​.​.​

Saturn (19364487) :- and then play with it
Saturn (19364487) :- or alternatively just zap it and make a new one at the start
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- Play with it?
Saturn (19364487) :- retab it
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- Oki.​
Saturn (19364487) :- and watch the ban number to see if it reduces or stays the same
