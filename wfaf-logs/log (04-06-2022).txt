<3 (24540494) :- but also the 
<3 (24540494) :- uh
<3 (24540494) :- the fact they are better with not native resolution from what i hear
<3 (24540494) :- bc they aren't restricted to a given constant number of pixels like lcds
Saturn (19364487) :- well they are very old tech
Saturn (19364487) :- take time to warm up and things
Saturn (19364487) :- use colossal voltages
<3 (24540494) :- they're better than plasmas tho
<3 (24540494) :- which came after crts
Saturn (19364487) :- fire electrons around the place fiercely
Saturn (19364487) :- dont get in the way :)

<3 (24540494) :- that's what we learnt about
<3 (24540494) :- idk about valves no
Saturn (19364487) :- there you go
Saturn (19364487) :- cute cat
Saturn (19364487) :- lumi send vacuum tube
<3 (24540494) :- aw she has a lil scarf
Lumi (16008266) :- Image: i.​\u200bimgur.​\u200bcom/VCF2Y8i.​\u200bjpeg
<3 (24540494) :- cutie
Saturn (19364487) :- there they are
Saturn (19364487) :- dont bend the prongs?!
<3 (24540494) :- yeah we learned that you had positive on top and negative at the bottom and a lilttle grid in the middle and you put either postive or negative on said grid and that made 
<3 (24540494) :- and that's how you regulated the thingy
<3 (24540494) :- and made it go faster or slower
Saturn (19364487) :- yess
<3 (24540494) :- we learned in relation to tranistors 
<3 (24540494) :- sort of a history lesson ig
Saturn (19364487) :- the grid current controlled the anode current
Saturn (19364487) :- before semiconductors were discovered
<3 (24540494) :- yeah yeah
Lumi (16008266) :- Hi, Purple Oblong! I'm afraid they aren't your friend yet, you can always try again!
Saturn (19364487) :- of course they need much less power, dont have warming up delays
Saturn (19364487) :- dont usually burn out
<3 (24540494) :- and they can get way smaller 
<3 (24540494) :- from what the teacher told us 
<3 (24540494) :- early computers were size of houses even
<3 (24540494) :- at some point
<3 (24540494) :- and all that just for simple calculations 
Saturn (19364487) :- yes
Saturn (19364487) :- for a long time you needed a whole room for a computer
Saturn (19364487) :- and there were magnetic tapes once
Saturn (19364487) :- you had to load them up and thread them
Saturn (19364487) :- so the computer could read and write to them
Saturn (19364487) :- and to find the right place it had to wind the tape for maybe miles and miles
Saturn (19364487) :- and the end of the tape tended to get mangled
<3 (24540494) :- sounds amazing
Saturn (19364487) :- there were tapes to keep music on too
Saturn (19364487) :- tape cassettes
<3 (24540494) :- yeah i remember those
Saturn (19364487) :- if you manged the tape you lost the music
<3 (24540494) :- kind of
Saturn (19364487) :- and tapes to record tv and video on
<3 (24540494) :- only heard about those
<3 (24540494) :- it was cds for me >.​>
<3 (24540494) :- as a kid
Saturn (19364487) :- same problem that if you mangled a bit of tape you lost the tv programme
Saturn (19364487) :- and that it took a while to get from one end of the tape to the other
<3 (24540494) :- because it had to physically wind it back up
Saturn (19364487) :- yes
Saturn (19364487) :- and hopefully not mangle it on the way
<3 (24540494) :- you could have stuff on both sides right?
<3 (24540494) :- like two different albums for example
Saturn (19364487) :- not sure about that
<3 (24540494) :- and you'd just flip the cassette 
Saturn (19364487) :- sounds like vinyl
Saturn (19364487) :- discs with tracks in
<3 (24540494) :- hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Saturn (19364487) :- that you put a needle into
<3 (24540494) :- yeah ik what vinyls are .​_.​
<3 (24540494) :- gimme a sec
Saturn (19364487) :- those can have A and B sides
Saturn (19364487) :- they used to put rubbish on the B sides
Saturn (19364487) :- there were different sizes that span at different speeds
Saturn (19364487) :- so your record player have to do the right speed
Saturn (19364487) :- or you get very strange deep music and things
<3 (24540494) :- Each side of the tape has its own, separate stereo audio track recorded to it.​\n\nSide A left and right channels are recorded on a track that is half the width of the tape.​\n\nWhen we flip it over, side B left and right channels are recorded on the other half of the width of the tape.​\n\nIf you could see the magnetic tracks on the tape, it would appear like 4 tracks - 2 for side A, and 2 for side B.​\n\nThere are machines that take advantage of these 4 tracks on a tape for multitrack recording, called 4 track recorders.​\n\nTapes from these machines play only on one side, unless you want to hear them backwards.​\n
Saturn (19364487) :- oh ok interesting
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Sky Blue Sullustan! Welcome to the place where your dreams used to come true!~
<3 (24540494) :- the vinyl players that had like the big trombone thing
<3 (24540494) :- the oooooold ones
<3 (24540494) :- they didn't have speakers right?
<3 (24540494) :- how did those work ; - ;
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, CODY (Clean Talks)! Welcome to the place where your dreams used to come true!~
Saturn (19364487) :- the trombone thing was to amplify the sound
<3 (24540494) :- oh
<3 (24540494) :- so they did have speakers?
Saturn (19364487) :- the sounds was made inside
<3 (24540494) :- ah
Saturn (19364487) :- no that was the speaker
<3 (24540494) :- right.​.​.​
<3 (24540494) :- well that's neat
Saturn (19364487) :- the needle in the track made the sound
<3 (24540494) :- golly gosh what would i ever do without you, pops >.​>
<3 (24540494) :- oh
<3 (24540494) :- how
Saturn (19364487) :- that must have been transmitted through the arm to the speaker
<3 (24540494) :- i thought the needle just like read it or smth
Saturn (19364487) :- the needle vibrated
<3 (24540494) :- and the trombone amplified it
Saturn (19364487) :- because the track changed shape
Saturn (19364487) :- yes
<3 (24540494) :- ah
<3 (24540494) :- that's so cooooooooool
Saturn (19364487) :- you could run a needle along the track manually but you woulld likely mess it up
Saturn (19364487) :- if you knoced the player the needle tended to jump oout of the track and make scresshy noises
Saturn (19364487) :- and there was a clever mechanism that  picked up the arm, moved it out across the disk and genty plonked it down into the right track
Saturn (19364487) :- and then you got crackly noises untill the music started
Lumi (16008266) :- shark do do do~
<3 (24540494) :- so the fact that the track is like physical  
<3 (24540494) :- is why it's supposed to be better?
<3 (24540494) :- bc you aren't restrained by digital data
<3 (24540494) :- and you have no digital compression
<3 (24540494) :- something likethat?
Saturn (19364487) :- well the track is physical, so its analogue
Saturn (19364487) :- an infinite range of values
Saturn (19364487) :- i wouldnt say it was better
Saturn (19364487) :- lots of scope for background noise
Saturn (19364487) :- another errror was when the needle got stuck in one track and went round and round
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Gold Coyote! Welcome to the place where your dreams used to come true!~

<3 (24540494) :- you traditionally sort of connect these chips and tubes with something called a thermal paste
<3 (24540494) :- but there's another thing called liquid metal that's supposed to do a much better job
<3 (24540494) :- but it also conducts electricity which can mean that if you spill it you can destroy your laptop completely
<3 (24540494) :- and ig i still feel like i somehow messed it up and i constantly await my laptop just going to the netherrealm
