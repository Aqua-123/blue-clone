Harenoir (11427049) :- (but i think that revolves around what jaz is expecting from you)
‏ (14267520) :- good old expectations
Harenoir (11427049) :- (otherwise she wouldn\'t feel ignored)
‏ (14267520) :- i mean i get her point as well 
‏ (14267520) :- but 
‏ (14267520) :- i got a billion things lined up as well in my life, a part of which is night

Harenoir (11427049) :- i get you have a life but
Harenoir (11427049) :- you can't let a relationship be your only corcern about it, that's where you have to keep everything in balance

‏ (14267520) :- right
‏ (14267520) :- at which i may be struggling at 
‏ (14267520) :- at the keeping-everything-at-balance
‏ (14267520) :- part
Harenoir (11427049) :- it seems.​.​.​ yeah
‏ (14267520) :- mildly frustrating
Harenoir (11427049) :- (ngl, as for me, as much as i'd want a relationship like that)
Harenoir (11427049) :- (sometimes i'm not sure if i'm up for it.​.​.​)
Harenoir (11427049) :- (because most people are always expecting something from the other)
‏ (14267520) :- (thats fair yeah, i hate that ive questioned myself about that even while being in a relationship)
Harenoir (11427049) :- (that's natural tbh, it makes you wonder if you're actually up for the challenge)
Harenoir (11427049) :- (and.​.​.​ it's all about keeping everything in balance)
‏ (14267520) :- (true)
Harenoir (11427049) :- (which.​.​.​ is truly hard at best)
‏ (14267520) :- (yeah yeah)
Harenoir (11427049) :- the only thing i can say for sure is.​.​.​
Harenoir (11427049) :- whatever you do next, don't lose your sanity in the process

Saturn (19364487) :- they only just bought it
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- They’re probably planning to just sell it on I don’t have any idea
Saturn (19364487) :- why do they want to sell it?
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- Cause this place has no hopes perhaps
Saturn (19364487) :- most people buy to sell at a profit
Saturn (19364487) :- otherwise its a lot of expense for nothing
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- I had checked the worth of this website by mistake one day not so long ago\n
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- It was indeed 100k+
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- All were thinking it was jokes\n
Saturn (19364487) :- i guess that is mostly the users not the website
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- No\n

Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- Yea that could be one possibility

Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- Moving people from one site\n
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- To some other.​
Saturn (19364487) :- because they can transfer us onto their super webchat app and make money off us

Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- .​.​.​
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- That was so random
Saturn (19364487) :- it was probably too much faff for Callan to maintain this website, and its much more difficult for anyone elese to do so
Saturn (19364487) :- so i think we are destined to be moved onto a more standard app
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- I guess the way this website is made is super broken 
Gashing Sphere (22975867) :- Which makes it impossible to fix 
Saturn (19364487) :- its very badly written
Saturn (19364487) :- even looking at it without much understanding
