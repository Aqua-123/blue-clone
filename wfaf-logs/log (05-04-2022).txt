spooky (20199174) :- ohh
spooky (20199174) :- haha
Saturn (19364487) :- but of course the karma system is totally insecure
spooky (20199174) :- now the real question is
spooky (20199174) :- yeah ur right
spooky (20199174) :- :(
Saturn (19364487) :- and the operation of the website is insecure because of the potential for karma to wreck it
Saturn (19364487) :- and there is no security on the less important stuff like all the stuff put up for friends, and the interests and so on
spooky (20199174) :- yeah
spooky (20199174) :- i thought there were mods in eme before
spooky (20199174) :- i guess you guys are mods now :)
Saturn (19364487) :- also the whole thing seems so badly written that in due course another exploit will show up

Saturn (19364487) :- and it can be hard being banned all over the place
Saturn (19364487) :- also GC is often crashed
spooky (20199174) :- but teri and aqua can fix all of that
spooky (20199174) :- cant they?
Saturn (19364487) :- bans are an arms war
Saturn (19364487) :- the more people bump karma up the more the bad guys bump it down
Saturn (19364487) :- GC crashes can be fixed
spooky (20199174) :- ohhh
Saturn (19364487) :- but i expect its the same or people fixing it while other people crash it
Saturn (19364487) :- to make eme work first karma needs to be totally zapped
spooky (20199174) :- W H A T
spooky (20199174) :- nooooooooooooooo
Saturn (19364487) :- then there needs to be proper fingerprinting of pics
Saturn (19364487) :- so that bad pics can be deleted and reported
spooky (20199174) :- ohh
Saturn (19364487) :- after that proper modetaion would be the way to go
Saturn (19364487) :- to drive out the spammers, harassers, disgusting people and so on

spooky (20199174) :- i see
spooky (20199174) :- can that be possible?
spooky (20199174) :- wiping out karma?
spooky (20199174) :- can aqua and teri do that?
