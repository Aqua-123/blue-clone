Saturn (19364487) :- theres no way you cn organise that
Saturn (19364487) :- if you are not in touch

Dydy (22811543) :- That's all i wanted to know 
„Ö§ (14267520) :- you arent trying to connect if you havent sent a friend request
<3 (24540494) :- along with everyone else in the group chat
Dydy (22811543) :- It can still be a plan B just in case 
Saturn (19364487) :- most people seem to go to the bottom GC for a private conversation

<3 (24540494) :- hey. . . 
Lil bunny (24655585) :- Um
Saturn (19364487) :- any justification for 2 plus 2 not being 4?
Lil bunny (24655585) :- Since I was 9
Lil bunny (24655585) :- Here sat
Lil bunny (24655585) :- We are taught from a young age that two plus two equals four; it is a given just as the earth is round, despite recent controversy.  But two plus two may not equal four due to two concepts: significant figures and rounding.  But why should you care about either of those two concepts? If you are subject to permit limits or standards those concepts can be the difference between compliance and noncompliance. \n\nThe stringency of a limit depends on the significant figures used in the numerical representation.  Say, for example, you have a limit of two parts per million (ppm).  If the limit is expressed numerically with one significant figure it would be 2, while it would be 2. 0 if expressed with two significant figures.  At first glance those numbers appear to be the same, but in reality they are ver
