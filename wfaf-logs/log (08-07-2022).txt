Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- die $thing, feminine
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- or das $thing
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- neutral, or neither

Saturn (19364487) :- The moons of Saturn are numerous and diverse, ranging from tiny moonlets only tens of meters across to enormous Titan, which is larger than the planet Mercury.  Saturn has 83 moons with confirmed orbits that are not embedded in its rings1--of which only 13 have diameters greater than 50 kilometers--as well as dense rings that contain millions of embedded moonlets and innumerable smaller ring particles. 234 Seven Saturnian moons are large enough to have collapsed into a relaxed, ellipsoidal shape, though only one or two of those, Titan and possibly Rhea, are currently in hydrostatic equilibrium.  Particularly notable among Saturn's moons are Titan, the second-largest moon in the Solar System (after Jupiter's Ganymede), with a nitrogen-rich Earth-like atmosphere and a landscape featuring 
Saturn (19364487) :- Twenty-four of Saturn's moons are regular satellites; they have prograde orbits not greatly inclined to Saturn's equatorial plane. 7 They include the seven major satellites, four small moons that exist in a trojan orbit with larger moons, two mutually co-orbital moons and two moons that act as shepherds of Saturn's F Ring.  Two other known regular satellites orbit within gaps in Saturn's rings.  The relatively large Hyperion is locked in a resonance with Titan.  The remaining regular moons orbit near the outer edge of the A Ring, within the G Ring and between the major moons Mimas and Enceladus.  The regular satellites are traditionally named after Titans and Titanesses or other figures associated with the mythological Saturn.

Saturn (19364487) :- There are still 30 unnamed moons (as of November 2021), of which all but one is irregular.  If named, they will receive names from Gallic, Norse and Inuit mythology based on the orbital groups of the moons.
