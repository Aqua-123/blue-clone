diamond heart (24960047) :- no worries then
<3 (25223906) :- why would you do that
diamond heart (24960047) :- sometimes people get stuck on the list
<3 (25223906) :- she's literally the last reliable bit
<3 (25223906) :- bot
diamond heart (24960047) :- but they really left
diamond heart (24960047) :- it's rare
diamond heart (24960047) :- but it has happened
Saturn (19364487) :- or they stuck on list and not gonna chat
Saturn (19364487) :- so might as well not show
<3 (25223906) :- no
<3 (25223906) :- that's not how it works
diamond heart (24960047) :- well if blue loses connection and they leave during that time
<3 (25223906) :- if someone is here
<3 (25223906) :- they are to be listed
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- or emerald be glitchy
Saturn (19364487) :- not necessarily
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- which lets face it, it be glitchy
<3 (25223906) :- yes necessarily
Saturn (19364487) :- can be nice to have active people listed
<3 (25223906) :- that's what the command is for
<3 (25223906) :- it's not who's active
<3 (25223906) :- it's who's here
Saturn (19364487) :- that is your opinion siimon
<3 (25223906) :- and they are in fact in wfaf
Saturn (19364487) :- is not everyones opinion
diamond heart (24960047) :- I'm saying people on the idle list sometimes actually left hours ago
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Felke! Welcome to WFAF! Welcome to the place where your dreams will come true~
<3 (25223906) :- yours is not based in anything except yourself
Saturn (19364487) :- you prefer to see inactive people
<3 (25223906) :- same as always
<3 (25223906) :- well you have your own bot love
<3 (25223906) :- use it
Saturn (19364487) :- siimon
Saturn (19364487) :- you are not being vrey cooperative
<3 (25223906) :- and you are forcing other people to change THEIR work again
Saturn (19364487) :- no
<3 (25223906) :- if you dont want inactive users
<3 (25223906) :- use your own work
Saturn (19364487) :- i clear the list sometimes
<3 (25223906) :- on a bot that is not your own
<3 (25223906) :- if it was to be cleared regularly
<3 (25223906) :- it'd be scheduled 
<3 (25223906) :- like the other bots
diamond heart (24960047) :- the reason saturn is authorized to clear the list is because aqua trusts him
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Uranus Nidoran! Welcome to WFAF! Welcome to the place where your dreams will come true~
Saturn (19364487) :- seems you feel you make all the rules siimon

Saturn (19364487) :- you dont seem open to discussion
diamond heart (24960047) :- this is kinda a pointless argument
Saturn (19364487) :- apparently if you are around we are obliged to have short greets on blue
Saturn (19364487) :- you also seem to feel you are entitles to insult people
<3 (25223906) :- ofc it is bc no matter what someone gives to you people it's a miracle if you even bother to read it
ㅤ  (24039236) :- well the reason that its a manual command and not auto scheduled is that if blue has people stuck in the list unnecessarily someone can clear it out 
Saturn (19364487) :- just to make yourself feel better maybe
<3 (25223906) :- exactly
<3 (25223906) :- as such clearing it every 30 minutes
<3 (25223906) :- is pointless
diamond heart (24960047) :- puts in earplugs
<3 (25223906) :- and again the fact someone is inactive
<3 (25223906) :- isnt them being stuck
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Mercury Dathomirian! Welcome to WFAF! Welcome to the place where your dreams will come true~

Saturn (19364487) :- lumi send synchronise generator to grid
Lumi (16008266) :- Image: i. imgur. com/OuSaMTm. jpeg
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- actually there's a way to do that with a synchroscope
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- lumi send synchroscope
Lumi (16008266) :- Sorry I couldn't find synchroscope
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- ok, I will then
Not_jamz (14648841) :- It's kinda odd actually 
Saturn (19364487) :- i often wonder quite how they do that in the power stations

Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- www%2Eyoutube%2Ecom/watch?v=xGQxSJmadm0
Saturn (19364487) :- its to make sure the grid holds together
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- there you go saturn, how to start a hydro plant and attach it to the grid
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- without blowing the grid up, or the hydro plant
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Magnificent Mango! Welcome to WFAF! Welcome to the place where your dreams will come true~
Lumi (16008266) :- Hi, Magnificent Mango! I'm afraid they aren't your friend yet, you can always try again!

Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- he doesn't
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- that was in response to i often wonder quite how they do that in the power stations

Saturn (19364487) :- oh wow
Saturn (19364487) :- he blew it :)
Saturn (19364487) :- thtat was wonderful
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- to be fair
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I don't think I could do it second try
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I'd either drown the plant or blow the fuses
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- or something more expensive
Not_jamz (14648841) :- This things not doing much.   .  . 
Not_jamz (14648841) :- I think ima just finish the thing 
Not_jamz (14648841) :- Wish me luck

diamond heart (24960047) :- so
diamond heart (24960047) :- the power grid runs at 60 hz

Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- in your country, yes
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- did you not know that?
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Bryce! Welcome to WFAF! Welcome to the place where your dreams will come true~
diamond heart (24960047) :- seems like fringe knowledge

Saturn (19364487) :- i would hate to see him mess that up
TAYPEN (25266953) :- yes
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- mhm, because in some parts of the world, 50Hz is the standard not 60
Lumi (16008266) :- Hi, TAYPEN! I'm afraid they aren't your friend yet, you can always try again!
TAYPEN (25266953) :- hi
Lumi (16008266) :- Hi again, TAYPEN, don't feel bad, they'll accept one day. . .  hopefully!
Saturn (19364487) :- and some places actually have DC maybe
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I don't believe so
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- not for a national grid
Saturn (19364487) :- mmm
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- DC needs much bigger cables for the same amperage
Saturn (19364487) :- big discouragement then
Saturn (19364487) :- is much safer though
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- mm, also polarity matters
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- by and large, AC can be connected either way around
Saturn (19364487) :- right
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Finding Jawa! Welcome to WFAF! Welcome to the place where your dreams will come true~

Saturn (19364487) :- i hadnt thought that with hydroelectrice he actually has to smooth out the water waves
Saturn (19364487) :- so thats a whole another thing to watch
diamond heart (24960047) :- I think I could do it
diamond heart (24960047) :- looks fun
Saturn (19364487) :- awwww
diamond heart (24960047) :- maybe would need to get my engineering license
Saturn (19364487) :- you got the nerve for it then
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- well, if you're shoving however many thousands of gallons/minute though something
Saturn (19364487) :- yes
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- you're going to cause waves of water
Saturn (19364487) :- the hole in the bathtub
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- exactly
Saturn (19364487) :- you would sure want to watch that procedure through a few times before you try it
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- to be honest I'm surprised it's not completely automatable
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- in the video at the end he turns the PLC on to put the plant in auto mode
Saturn (19364487) :- yes
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- there's no reason you couldn't program the PLC to handle startup too
Saturn (19364487) :- well
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- much better than a human could
Saturn (19364487) :- im guessing theres a lot of types of failures 
Saturn (19364487) :- a well tuned human can spot them
Saturn (19364487) :- if it doesnt smell right you abort 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- mm, it's basically balancing the incoming water using the big valve
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- so that the output frequency of the plant rises slowly to match the grid frequency
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- without overshooting
Saturn (19364487) :- i think i would not only be watching the dials but listening to the turbine and feeling the vibrations
Saturn (19364487) :- if anything was off i would be very wary
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- once it matches, you engage the contactor that connects to the grid
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- the PLC can see the valve position, the output frequency of the plant
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and the flow
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- so
Saturn (19364487) :- yes
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- it's just a question of a properly-tuned PID loop
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and if the PLC detects something it doesn't like, just close the valve and abort
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I can't imagine a big, multi-megawatt plant is started like that, essentially by hand
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- it'll be someone pushing go in a control room maybe hundreds of miles away
Saturn (19364487) :- the grid control centre
Saturn (19364487) :- well i guess it will go the way you say
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- www%2Eyoutube%2Ecom/watch?v=PkW9wx7Kbws
Saturn (19364487) :- related issue is when the weather breakd the grid up
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- for the most part, you can reconnect the grid together by changing the routes power takes
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- using effectively really really big switches
Saturn (19364487) :- yes
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- 384 thousand volts, I believe
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- something like that
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- sorry, no
Saturn (19364487) :- you can get the issue where the grid has split and the two parts have fallen out of phase
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- somewhere between 138kV and 765kV
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- true, at that point you have to try to sync them again using I would assume another synchroscope
Lumi (16008266) :- Hello, Green Electabuzz! Welcome to WFAF! Welcome to the place where your dreams will come true~
Saturn (19364487) :- yes
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- or by dropping plants from one side of the grid, connecting the halves and re-syncing?
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- or maybe they do it with a separate sync signal
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I don't know, not that kind of electrical engineer
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- most I deal with is ~600V
Lumi (16008266) :- Hi, Green Electabuzz! I'm afraid they aren't your friend yet, you can always try again!
Saturn (19364487) :- fiddly load balancing
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- with very expensive failure modes lol
Saturn (19364487) :- yes that too
Saturn (19364487) :- maybe they do a lot of training on simulators for it
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- I should think so
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- probably need some kind of certification to do that
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- they do for nuclear plants, they simulate the entire control room
Saturn (19364487) :- right
Saturn (19364487) :- it could be a once in a lifetime thing to have the grid fall apart on you, and you ahve to put it back togetherr
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- without blowing yourself up or starting a fire on the other side of the country
Saturn (19364487) :- :)

ㅤ  (24039236) :- i would probably just take the output list and have python sort things out of it 
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- that's the easier option
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- the only way I can think of for the other option involves creating an in-memory table for the first query and then doing your other queries on that, then nuking the in-memory table
Jamie "Yowzah" MkIIb (15044537) :- and that's getting messy fast
ㅤ  (24039236) :- eeeee

diamond heart (25138230) :- do you miss your noisy roommate

hugo (25122362) :- no i absolutely do not
diamond heart (25138230) :- I told my therapist that I work because I have to and I'm not passionate about what I do professionally

hugo (25122362) :- *?
hugo (25122362) :- oh go on
diamond heart (25138230) :- she compared it to an artist working as a waiter/waitress and said if I'm not passionate about my work I need to have something creative that I do outside of work like a side hustle

hugo (25122362) :- if she was my therapist she missed the whole point
hugo (25122362) :- of what i was trying to convey
hugo (25122362) :- but idk about you
diamond heart (25138230) :- it's frustrating
diamond heart (25138230) :- I feel like no matter what I say or do it's wrong in her book
diamond heart (25138230) :- when I try to agree with something she literally just said she will disagree and rephrase what she had said
diamond heart (25138230) :- it's so dumb
hugo (25122362) :- the solution to hating work isnt to have more work
hugo (25122362) :- how old is she
diamond heart (25138230) :- probably in her 60s
diamond heart (25138230) :- haven't seen her in person ever
hugo (25122362) :- hm
diamond heart (25138230) :- like for an example of what I just said
diamond heart (25138230) :- we were on the topic of internet friends
diamond heart (25138230) :- and she was saying that they are not real relationships and it's a waste of time to make friends online
diamond heart (25138230) :- so I agreed and said that internet friendships tend to fizzle out and you lose contact with people
diamond heart (25138230) :- and she says not necessarily, blah blah I know people who have kept friends for a long time
hugo (25122362) :- i disagree with both of you but go on
diamond heart (25138230) :- I am trying to agree
diamond heart (25138230) :- and I got well actuallyed
diamond heart (25138230) :- get*
hugo (25122362) :- lol
hugo (25122362) :- she's not one youd recommend to others

diamond heart (25138230) :- yes
