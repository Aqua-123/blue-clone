Lumi(16008266) :-Hello, Doug! Welcome to WFAF! - Waiting for a Friend! The place where your dreams used to come true~
Cryo(22783061) :-it maybe wouldve
Harenoir(11427049) :-hm...
Cryo(22783061) :-it wouldve somewhat ended up like this
Cryo(22783061) :-but the journey till here would have been much more joyful..
Cryo(22783061) :-if that makes sense
Harenoir(11427049) :-yes, ive thought about that
Harenoir(11427049) :-same result, less hard feelings
Cryo(22783061) :-mhm
Harenoir(11427049) :-altho its funny how i overall valued karma way more than actual trust between people
Harenoir(11427049) :-i mean, i know im cold by nature, but... meh
Cryo(22783061) :-mhmm
Harenoir(11427049) :-after enough time, you stop seeing people as people, and they just become pawns in a chessboard
Harenoir(11427049) :-and that considering im bad at chess
Cryo(22783061) :-hmmm
Cryo(22783061) :-thats... an interesting metaphor to use for people
Harenoir(11427049) :-hm
Harenoir(11427049) :-that was my perspective of what happened last year
Harenoir(11427049) :-get to know people just to see how they would fit in my next plan
Cryo(22783061) :-ah
Cryo(22783061) :-now it makes more sense
Lumi(16008266) :-Hi, Omnissiah! Im afraid they arent your friend yet, you can always try again!
Lumi(16008266) :-Hello, Omnissiah! Welcome to WFAF! - Waiting for a Friend! The place where your dreams used to come true~
Lumi(16008266) :-Mecha nurse is here, everyone get ready for your shots ðŸ’‰ ðŸ’Š
Harenoir(11427049) :-so in a way, i wasnt trusting anyone with anything, just making sure people would act in certain ways
Harenoir(11427049) :-and by that, by any means possible, i\d end up getting the most fast farming method
Lumi(16008266) :-Hello, Violentspace! Welcome to WFAF! - Waiting for a Friend! The place where your dreams used to come true~
Violentspace(23364430) :-hi
Cryo(22783061) :-right
Harenoir(11427049) :-and its also funny the fact that my plan successed in the end
Harenoir(11427049) :-i got want i wanted
Harenoir(11427049) :-except that i never actually thought about making true friendships
Harenoir(11427049) :-everyone was already nice to me by default, and i was happy with that
Cryo(22783061) :-mhm
Harenoir(11427049) :-so.... yeah, when it all happened, thats when i started seeing things in a different way
Harenoir(11427049) :-people telling me they trusted me and so on...
Cryo(22783061) :-right right
Harenoir(11427049) :-even if i end up like a hypocrite because i farmed people down, just to get along with them like if nothing happened at the same time
Cryo(22783061) :-that... yea
