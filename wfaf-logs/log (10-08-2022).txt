⸢ Ritsu ⸥ (20597891) :- i already know how i would store data and the such
Blue (21550262) :- Right sure thing

⸢ Ritsu ⸥ (20597891) :- oh i wouldnt have guessed that honestly, i thought that when you transitioned from JSON to that Python format thing that it would be fast
ㅤ  (24039236) :- Well she has about 1. 8 millions lines of data in sql
⸢ Ritsu ⸥ (20597891) :- because i recall something about how it directly addresses per key
ㅤ  (24039236) :- So that in json would be a mess

⸢ Ritsu ⸥ (20597891) :- but why though
⸢ Ritsu ⸥ (20597891) :- why would she need 1. 8m lines of data
